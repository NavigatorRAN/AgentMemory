Using templates
Example
The MQTT climate integration Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] lets you control your MQTT enabled HVAC devices.
To use an MQTT climate in your installation, add an MQTT device as a subentry , or add the following to your configuration.yaml The configuration.yaml file is the main configuration file for Home Assistant. It lists the integrations to be loaded and their specific configurations. In some cases, the configuration needs to be edited manually directly in the configuration.yaml file. Most integrations can be configured in the UI. [Learn more] file.
After changing the configuration.yaml The configuration.yaml file is the main configuration file for Home Assistant. It lists the integrations to be loaded and their specific configurations. In some cases, the configuration needs to be edited manually directly in the configuration.yaml file. Most integrations can be configured in the UI. [Learn more] file, restart Home Assistant to apply the changes.
# Example configuration.yaml entry mqtt : - climate : name : Study mode_command_topic : " study/ac/mode/set"
Alternatively, you can set it up via MQTT discovery .
Configuration Variables
Looking for your configuration file?
action_template template ( Optional )
A template to render the value received on the action_topic with.
action_topic string ( Optional )
The MQTT topic to subscribe for changes of the current action. If this is set, the climate graph uses the value received as data source. A “None” payload resets the current action state. An empty payload is ignored. Valid action values: off , heating , cooling , drying , idle , fan .
availability list ( Optional )
A list of MQTT topics subscribed to receive availability (online/offline) updates. Must not be used together with availability_topic .
payload_available string ( Optional , default: online )
The payload that represents the available state.
payload_not_available string ( Optional , default: offline )
The payload that represents the unavailable state.
topic string Required
An MQTT topic subscribed to receive availability (online/offline) updates.
value_template template ( Optional )
Defines a template to extract device’s availability from the topic . To determine the devices’s availability result of this template will be compared to payload_available and payload_not_available .
availability_mode string ( Optional , default: latest )
When availability is configured, this controls the conditions needed to set the entity to available . Valid entries are all , any , and latest . If set to all , payload_available must be received on all configured availability topics before the entity is marked as online. If set to any , payload_available must be received on at least one configured availability topic before the entity is marked as online. If set to latest , the last payload_available or payload_not_available received on any configured availability topic controls the availability.
availability_template template ( Optional )
Defines a template to extract device’s availability from the availability_topic . To determine the devices’s availability result of this template will be compared to payload_available and payload_not_available .
availability_topic string ( Optional )
The MQTT topic subscribed to receive availability (online/offline) updates. Must not be used together with availability .
current_humidity_template template ( Optional )
A template with which the value received on current_humidity_topic will be rendered.
current_humidity_topic string ( Optional )
The MQTT topic on which to listen for the current humidity. A "None" value received will reset the current humidity. Empty values ( ''' ) will be ignored.

unique_id string ( Optional )
An ID that uniquely identifies this HVAC device. If two HVAC devices have the same unique ID, Home Assistant will raise an exception. Required when used with device-based discovery.
Default template to render the payloads on all *_state_topic s with.
If a property works in optimistic mode (when the corresponding state topic is not set), Home Assistant will assume that any state changes published to the command topics did work and change the internal state of the entity immediately after publishing to the command topic. If it does not work in optimistic mode, the internal state of the entity is only updated when the requested update is confirmed by the device through the state topic. You can enforce optimistic mode by setting the optimistic option to true . When set, the internal state will always be updated, even when a state topic is defined.
For all *_state_topic s, a template can be specified that will be used to render the incoming payloads on these topics. Also, a default template that applies to all state topics can be specified as value_template . This can be useful if the payloads you receive are, for example, in JSON format. Since in JSON, a quoted string (for example, "foo" ) is just a string, this can also be used for unquoting.
Say you receive the operation mode "auto" via your mode_state_topic , but the mode is actually called just auto , here’s what you could do:
mqtt : - climate : name : Study modes : - " off" - " heat" - " auto" mode_command_topic : " study/ac/mode/set" mode_state_topic : " study/ac/mode/state" mode_state_template : " {{ value_json }}"
This will parse the incoming "auto" as JSON, resulting in auto . Obviously, in this case you could also just set value_template: "{{ value_json }}" .
Similarly for *_command_topic s, a template can be specified to render the outgoing payloads on these topics.
A full configuration example looks like the one below.
