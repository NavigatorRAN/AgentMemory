Gateway & Ops Gateway
Use this page for day-1 startup and day-2 operations of the Gateway service.
Deep troubleshooting
Symptom-first diagnostics with exact command ladders and log signatures.
Configuration
Task-oriented setup guide + full configuration reference.
Secrets management
SecretRef contract, runtime snapshot behavior, and migrate/reload operations.
Secrets plan contract
Exact secrets apply target/path rules and ref-only auth-profile behavior.
5-minute local startup
Start the Gateway
bash Copy code openclaw gateway --port 18789 # debug/trace mirrored to stdio openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose # force-kill listener on selected port, then start openclaw gateway --force
Verify service health
bash Copy code openclaw gateway status openclaw status openclaw logs --follow
Healthy baseline: Runtime: running , Connectivity probe: ok , and Capability: ... that matches what you expect. Use openclaw gateway status --require-rpc when you need read-scope RPC proof, not just reachability.
Validate channel readiness
bash Copy code openclaw channels status --probe
With a reachable gateway this runs live per-account channel probes and optional audits.
If the gateway is unreachable, the CLI falls back to config-only channel summaries instead
of live probe output.
Note
Gateway config reload watches the active config file path (resolved from profile/state defaults, or OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH when set).
Default mode is gateway.reload.mode="hybrid" .
After the first successful load, the running process serves the active in-memory config snapshot; successful reload swaps that snapshot atomically.
Runtime model
One always-on process for routing, control plane, and channel connections.
Single multiplexed port for:
WebSocket control/RPC
HTTP APIs ( /v1/models , /v1/embeddings , /v1/chat/completions , /v1/responses , /tools/invoke )
Plugin HTTP routes, such as optional /api/v1/admin/rpc
Control UI and hooks
Default bind mode: loopback .
Auth is required by default. Shared-secret setups use
gateway.auth.token / gateway.auth.password (or
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN / OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD ), and non-loopback
reverse-proxy setups can use gateway.auth.mode: "trusted-proxy" .
OpenAI-compatible endpoints
OpenClaw's highest-leverage compatibility surface is now:
GET /v1/models
GET /v1/models/{id}
POST /v1/embeddings
POST /v1/chat/completions
POST /v1/responses
Why this set matters:
Most Open WebUI, LobeChat, and LibreChat integrations probe /v1/models first.
Many RAG and memory pipelines expect /v1/embeddings .
Agent-native clients increasingly prefer /v1/responses .
Planning note:
/v1/models is agent-first: it returns openclaw , openclaw/default , and openclaw/<agentId> .
openclaw/default is the stable alias that always maps to the configured default agent.
Use x-openclaw-model when you want a backend provider/model override; otherwise the selected agent's normal model and embedding setup stays in control.
All of these run on the main Gateway port and use the same trusted operator auth boundary as the rest of the Gateway HTTP API.
Admin HTTP RPC ( POST /api/v1/admin/rpc ) is a separate, default-off plugin route for host tooling that cannot use WebSocket RPC. See Admin HTTP RPC .
Port and bind precedence
Setting Resolution order Gateway port --port → OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT → gateway.port → 18789 Bind mode CLI/override → gateway.bind → loopback
Installed gateway services record the resolved --port in supervisor metadata. After changing gateway.port , run openclaw doctor --fix or openclaw gateway install --force so launchd/systemd/schtasks starts the process on the new port.
Gateway startup uses the same effective port and bind when it seeds local
Control UI origins for non-loopback binds. For example, --bind lan --port 3000
seeds http://localhost:3000 and http://127.0.0.1:3000 before runtime
validation runs. Add any remote browser origins, such as HTTPS proxy URLs, to
gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins explicitly.
Hot reload modes
gateway.reload.mode Behavior off No config reload hot Apply only hot-safe changes restart Restart on reload-required changes hybrid (default) Hot-apply when safe, restart when required
Operator command set
bash Copy code openclaw gateway status openclaw gateway status --deep # adds a system-level service scan openclaw gateway status --json openclaw gateway install openclaw gateway restart openclaw gateway stop openclaw secrets reload openclaw logs --follow openclaw doctor
gateway status --deep is for extra service discovery (LaunchDaemons/systemd system
units/schtasks), not a deeper RPC health probe.
Multiple gateways (same host)
Most installs should run one gateway per machine. A single gateway can host multiple
agents and channels.
You only need multiple gateways when you intentionally want isolation or a rescue bot.
Useful checks:
bash Copy code openclaw gateway status --deep openclaw gateway probe
What to expect:
gateway status --deep can report Other gateway-like services detected (best effort)
and print cleanup hints when stale launchd/systemd/schtasks installs are still around.
gateway probe can warn about multiple reachable gateway identities when distinct
gateways answer, or when OpenClaw cannot prove reachable targets are the same gateway.
An SSH tunnel, proxy URL, or configured remote URL to the same gateway is one
gateway with multiple transports, even when transport ports differ.
If that is intentional, isolate ports, config/state, and workspace roots per gateway.
Checklist per instance:
Unique gateway.port
Unique OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH
Unique OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR
Unique agents.defaults.workspace
Example:
bash Copy code OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.openclaw/a.json OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.openclaw-a openclaw gateway --port 19001 OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.openclaw/b.json OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.openclaw-b openclaw gateway --port 19002
Detailed setup: /gateway/multiple-gateways .
Remote access
Preferred: Tailscale/VPN.
Fallback: SSH tunnel.
bash Copy code ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host
Then connect clients locally to ws://127.0.0.1:18789 .
Warning
SSH tunnels do not bypass gateway auth. For shared-secret auth, clients still
must send token / password even over the tunnel. For identity-bearing modes,
the request still has to satisfy that auth path.
See: Remote Gateway , Authentication , Tailscale .
Supervision and service lifecycle
Use supervised runs for production-like reliability.
macOS (launchd)
bash Copy code openclaw gateway install openclaw gateway status openclaw gateway restart openclaw gateway stop
Use openclaw gateway restart for restarts. Do not chain openclaw gateway stop and openclaw gateway start as a restart substitute.
On macOS, gateway stop uses launchctl bootout by default — this removes the LaunchAgent from the current boot session without persisting a disable, so KeepAlive auto-recovery still works after unexpected crashes and gateway start re-enables cleanly. To persistently suppress auto-respawn across reboots, pass --disable : openclaw gateway stop --disable .
LaunchAgent labels are ai.openclaw.gateway (default) or ai.openclaw.<profile> (named profile). openclaw doctor audits and repairs service config drift.
Linux (systemd user)
bash Copy code openclaw gateway install systemctl --user enable --now openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service openclaw gateway status
For persistence after logout, enable lingering:
bash Copy code sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>
Manual user-unit example when you need a custom install path:
ini Copy code [Unit] Description =OpenClaw Gateway After =network- on line.target Wants =network- on line.target [Service] ExecStart =/usr/local/bin/openclaw gateway --port 18789 Restart =always RestartSec = 5 TimeoutStopSec = 30 TimeoutStartSec = 30 SuccessExitStatus = 0 143 OOMPolicy =continue KillMode =control-group [Install] WantedBy =default.target
Windows (native)
powershell Copy code openclaw gateway install openclaw gateway status --json openclaw gateway restart openclaw gateway stop
Native Windows managed startup uses a Scheduled Task named OpenClaw Gateway
(or OpenClaw Gateway (<profile>) for named profiles). If Scheduled Task
creation is denied, OpenClaw falls back to a per-user Startup-folder launcher
that points at gateway.cmd inside the state directory.
Linux (system service)
Use a system unit for multi-user/always-on hosts.
bash Copy code sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable --now openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service
Use the same service body as the user unit, but install it under
/etc/systemd/system/openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service and adjust
ExecStart= if your openclaw binary lives elsewhere.
Do not also let openclaw doctor --fix install a user-level gateway service for the same profile/port. Doctor refuses that automatic install when it finds a system-level OpenClaw gateway service; use OPENCLAW_SERVICE_REPAIR_POLICY=external when the system unit owns the lifecycle.
Dev profile quick path
bash Copy code openclaw --dev setup openclaw --dev gateway --allow-unconfigured openclaw --dev status
Defaults include isolated state/config and base gateway port 19001 .
Protocol quick reference (operator view)
First client frame must be connect .
Gateway returns hello-ok snapshot ( presence , health , stateVersion , uptimeMs , limits/policy).
hello-ok.features.methods / events are a conservative discovery list, not
a generated dump of every callable helper route.
Requests: req(method, params) → res(ok/payload|error) .
Common events include connect.challenge , agent , chat ,
session.message , session.operation , session.tool , sessions.changed ,
presence , tick , health , heartbeat , pairing/approval lifecycle events,
and shutdown .
Agent runs are two-stage:
Immediate accepted ack ( status:"accepted" )
Final completion response ( status:"ok"|"error" ), with streamed agent events in between.
See full protocol docs: Gateway Protocol .
Operational checks
Liveness
Open WS and send connect .
Expect hello-ok response with snapshot.
Readiness
bash Copy code openclaw gateway status openclaw channels status --probe openclaw health
Gap recovery
Events are not replayed. On sequence gaps, refresh state ( health , system-presence ) before continuing.
Common failure signatures
Signature Likely issue refusing to bind gateway ... without auth Non-loopback bind without a valid gateway auth path another gateway instance is already listening / EADDRINUSE Port conflict Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local Config set to remote mode, or local-mode stamp is missing from a damaged config unauthorized during connect Auth mismatch between client and gateway
For full diagnosis ladders, use Gateway Troubleshooting .
Safety guarantees
Gateway protocol clients fail fast when Gateway is unavailable (no implicit direct-channel fallback).
Invalid/non-connect first frames are rejected and closed.
Graceful shutdown emits shutdown event before socket close.
