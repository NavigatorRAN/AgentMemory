Install Hosting
Shared runtime steps for VM-based Docker installs such as GCP, Hetzner, and similar VPS providers.
Bake required binaries into the image
Installing binaries inside a running container is a trap.
Anything installed at runtime will be lost on restart.
All external binaries required by skills must be installed at image build time.
The examples below show three common binaries only:
gog (from gogcli ) for Gmail access
goplaces for Google Places
wacli for WhatsApp
These are examples, not a complete list.
You may install as many binaries as needed using the same pattern.
If you add new skills later that depend on additional binaries, you must:
Update the Dockerfile
Rebuild the image
Restart the containers
Example Dockerfile
dockerfile Copy code FROM node: 24 -bookworm RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y socat && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* # Example binary 1: Gmail CLI (gogcli — installs as `gog`) # Copy the current Linux asset URL from https://github.com/steipete/gogcli/releases RUN curl -L https://github.com/steipete/gogcli/releases/latest/download/gogcli_linux_amd64.tar.gz \ | tar -xzO gog > /usr/local/bin/gog; \ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gog # Example binary 2: Google Places CLI # Copy the current Linux asset URL from https://github.com/steipete/goplaces/releases RUN curl -L https://github.com/steipete/goplaces/releases/latest/download/goplaces_linux_amd64.tar.gz \ | tar -xzO goplaces > /usr/local/bin/goplaces; \ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/goplaces # Example binary 3: WhatsApp CLI # Copy the current Linux asset URL from https://github.com/steipete/wacli/releases RUN curl -L https://github.com/steipete/wacli/releases/latest/download/wacli-linux-amd64.tar.gz \ | tar -xzO wacli > /usr/local/bin/wacli; \ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wacli # Add more binaries below using the same pattern WORKDIR /app COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml pnpm-workspace.yaml .npmrc ./ COPY ui/package.json ./ui/package.json COPY scripts ./scripts RUN corepack enable RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile COPY . . RUN pnpm build RUN pnpm ui:install RUN pnpm ui:build ENV NODE_ENV=production CMD [ "node" , "dist/index.js" ] Note
The URLs above are examples. For ARM-based VMs, choose the arm64 assets. For reproducible builds, pin versioned release URLs.
Build and launch
bash Copy code docker compose build docker compose up -d openclaw-gateway
If build fails with Killed or exit code 137 during pnpm install --frozen-lockfile , the VM is out of memory.
Use a larger machine class before retrying.
Verify binaries:
bash Copy code docker compose exec openclaw-gateway which gog docker compose exec openclaw-gateway which goplaces docker compose exec openclaw-gateway which wacli
Expected output:
Code Copy code /usr/local/bin/gog /usr/local/bin/goplaces /usr/local/bin/wacli
Verify Gateway:
bash Copy code docker compose logs -f openclaw-gateway
Code Copy code [gateway] listening on ws://0.0.0.0:18789
What persists where
OpenClaw runs in Docker, but Docker is not the source of truth.
All long-lived state must survive restarts, rebuilds, and reboots.

bash Copy code git pull docker compose build docker compose up -d
