Models Providers
Groq provides ultra-fast inference on open-weight models (Llama, Gemma, Kimi, Qwen, GPT OSS, and more) using custom LPU hardware. The Groq plugin registers both an OpenAI-compatible chat provider and an audio media-understanding provider.
Property Value Provider id groq Plugin official external package Auth env var GROQ_API_KEY API OpenAI-compatible ( openai-completions ) Base URL https://api.groq.com/openai/v1 Audio transcription whisper-large-v3-turbo (default) Suggested chat default groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile
Install plugin
Install the official plugin, then restart Gateway:
bash Copy code openclaw plugins install @openclaw/groq-provider openclaw gateway restart
Getting started
Get an API key
Create an API key at console.groq.com/keys .
Set the API key
bash Copy code export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
Set a default model
json5 Copy code { agents : { defaults : { model : { primary : "groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile" }, }, }, }
Verify the catalog is reachable
bash Copy code openclaw models list --provider groq
Config file example
json5 Copy code { env : { GROQ_API_KEY : "gsk_..." }, agents : { defaults : { model : { primary : "groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile" }, }, }, }
Built-in catalog
OpenClaw ships a manifest-backed Groq catalog with both reasoning and non-reasoning entries. Run openclaw models list --provider groq to see the static rows for your installed version, or check console.groq.com/docs/models for Groq's authoritative list.

Tip
The catalog evolves with each OpenClaw release. openclaw models list --provider groq shows the rows known to your installed version; cross-check with console.groq.com/docs/models for newly-added or deprecated models.
Reasoning models
OpenClaw maps its shared /think levels to Groq's model-specific reasoning_effort values:
For qwen/qwen3-32b , disabled thinking sends none and enabled thinking sends default .
For Groq GPT OSS reasoning models ( openai/gpt-oss-* ), OpenClaw sends low , medium , or high based on /think level. Disabled thinking omits reasoning_effort because those models do not support a disabled value.
DeepSeek R1 Distill, Qwen QwQ, and Compound use Groq's native reasoning surface; /think controls visibility but the model always reasons.
See Thinking modes for the shared /think levels and how OpenClaw translates them per provider.
Audio transcription
Groq's plugin also registers an audio media-understanding provider so voice messages can be transcribed through the shared tools.media.audio surface.
Property Value Shared config path tools.media.audio Default base URL https://api.groq.com/openai/v1 Default model whisper-large-v3-turbo Auto priority 20 API endpoint OpenAI-compatible /audio/transcriptions
To make Groq the default audio backend:
json5 Copy code { tools : { media : { audio : { models : [{ provider : "groq" }], }, }, }, }
Environment availability for the daemon
If the Gateway runs as a managed service (launchd, systemd, Docker), GROQ_API_KEY must be visible to that process — not just to your interactive shell.
Warning
A key exported only in an interactive shell will not help a launchd or systemd daemon unless that environment is imported there too. Set the key in ~/.openclaw/.env or via env.shellEnv to make it readable from the gateway process.
Custom Groq model ids
OpenClaw accepts any Groq model id at runtime. Use the exact id shown by Groq and prefix it with groq/ . The static catalog covers the common cases; uncatalogued ids fall through to the default OpenAI-compatible template.
json5 Copy code { agents : { defaults : { model : { primary : "groq/<your-model-id>" }, }, }, }
