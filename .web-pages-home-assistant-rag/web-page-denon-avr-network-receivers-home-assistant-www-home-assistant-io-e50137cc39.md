Other Denon AVR receivers (untested)
Marantz receivers (experimental)
If your model is not on the list then give it a test, if everything works correctly then add it to the list by clicking on the Edit link at the bottom of this page.
If you are using VLANs, Home Assistant needs access to the following ports on the AVR: 23, 8080, and 60006 (all TCP).
Warning
If you have something else using the IP controller for your Denon AVR 3808CI, such as your URC controller, it will not work! There is either a bug or security issue with some models where only one device could be controlling the IP functionality.
To add the Denon AVR Network Receivers device to your Home Assistant instance, use this My button:
Denon AVR Network Receivers can be auto-discovered by Home Assistant. If an instance was found,
it will be shown as Discovered . You can then set it up right away.
Manual configuration steps
If it wasn’t discovered automatically, don’t worry! You can set up a
manual integration entry:
Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
Go to Settings > Devices & services .
In the bottom right corner, select the
Add Integration button.
From the list, select Denon AVR Network Receivers .
Follow the instructions on screen to complete the setup.
host
IP address of the device, for example, 192.168.1.32 . If not set, auto-discovery is used.
show_all_sources
If True all sources are displayed in sources list even if they are marked as deleted in the receiver. If False deleted sources are not displayed. Some receivers have a bug that marks all sources as deleted in the interface. In this case, this option could help.
zone2
Specifies if zone 2 should be activated. Zones are displayed as additional media players with the same functionality as the Main Zone of the device supports.
zone3
Specifies if zone 3 should be activated. Zones are displayed as additional media players with the same functionality as the Main Zone of the device supports. Some receivers do not support a second zone.
update_audyssey
Specifies if Audyssey settings should be updated. This can take up to 10 seconds for some receivers.
use_telnet
Specifies if a telnet connection should be used to receive device status updates. Using telnet provides realtime updates (local push) for many values but each receiver is limited to a single connection. If you enable this setting, no other connection to your device can be made via telnet. This will be set to true for new installations of the integration but false for existing installs to prevent compatibility issues.
A few notes:
An additional option for the control of Denon AVR receivers with a built-in web server is using the HTTP interface with denonavr platform.
The denonavr platform supports some additional functionalities like album covers, custom input source names and auto discovery.
Marantz receivers seem to a have quite a similar interface. Thus if you own one, give it a try.
To remotely power on Marantz receivers with Home Assistant, the Auto-Standby feature must be enabled in the receiver’s settings.
Sound mode: The command to set a specific sound mode is different from the value of the current sound mode reported by the receiver (sound_mode_raw). There is a key-value structure (sound_mode_dict) that matches the raw sound mode to one of the possible commands to set a sound mode (for instance {‘MUSIC’:[‘PLII MUSIC’]}. If you get a “Not able to match sound mode” warning, please open an issue on the denonavr library , stating which raw sound mode could not be matched so it can be added to the matching dictionary. You can find the current raw sound mode under Settings > Developer tools > States .
The Denon AVR Network Receivers integration Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] provides the following actions. Each link below opens a dedicated page with examples, parameters, and a step-by-step UI walkthrough.
Get command ( denonavr.get_command )
Send a generic HTTP command to a Denon AVR receiver over the network.
Set dynamic equalizer ( denonavr.set_dynamic_eq )
Enable or disable the DynamicEQ setting on a Denon AVR receiver.
Update Audyssey ( denonavr.update_audyssey )
Update the Audyssey settings on a Denon AVR receiver.
