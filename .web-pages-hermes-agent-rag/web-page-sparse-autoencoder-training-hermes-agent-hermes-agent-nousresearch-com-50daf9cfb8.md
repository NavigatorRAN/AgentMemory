The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
SAELens: Sparse Autoencoders for Mechanistic Interpretability
SAELens is the primary library for training and analyzing Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) - a technique for decomposing polysemantic neural network activations into sparse, interpretable features. Based on Anthropic's groundbreaking research on monosemanticity.
GitHub : jbloomAus/SAELens (1,100+ stars)
The Problem: Polysemanticity & Superposition ​
Individual neurons in neural networks are polysemantic - they activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. This happens because models use superposition to represent more features than they have neurons, making interpretability difficult.
SAEs solve this by decomposing dense activations into sparse, monosemantic features - typically only a small number of features activate for any given input, and each feature corresponds to an interpretable concept.
When to Use SAELens ​
Use SAELens when you need to:
Discover interpretable features in model activations
Understand what concepts a model has learned
Study superposition and feature geometry
Perform feature-based steering or ablation
Analyze safety-relevant features (deception, bias, harmful content)
Consider alternatives when:
You need basic activation analysis → Use TransformerLens directly
You want causal intervention experiments → Use pyvene or TransformerLens
You need production steering → Consider direct activation engineering
Installation ​
pip install sae-lens
Requirements: Python 3.10+, transformer-lens>=2.0.0
Core Concepts ​
What SAEs Learn ​
SAEs are trained to reconstruct model activations through a sparse bottleneck:
Input Activation → Encoder → Sparse Features → Decoder → Reconstructed Activation
(d_model) ↓ (d_sae >> d_model) ↓ (d_model)
sparsity reconstruction
penalty loss
Loss Function : MSE(original, reconstructed) + L1_coefficient × L1(features)
Key Validation (Anthropic Research) ​
In "Towards Monosemanticity", human evaluators found 70% of SAE features genuinely interpretable . Features discovered include:
DNA sequences, legal language, HTTP requests
Hebrew text, nutrition statements, code syntax
Sentiment, named entities, grammatical structures
Workflow 1: Loading and Analyzing Pre-trained SAEs ​
Step-by-Step ​
from transformer_lens import HookedTransformer
from sae_lens import SAE
# 1. Load model and pre-trained SAE
model = HookedTransformer . from_pretrained ( "gpt2-small" , device = "cuda" )
sae , cfg_dict , sparsity = SAE . from_pretrained (
release = "gpt2-small-res-jb" ,
sae_id = "blocks.8.hook_resid_pre" ,
device = "cuda"
)
# 2. Get model activations
tokens = model . to_tokens ( "The capital of France is Paris" )
_ , cache = model . run_with_cache ( tokens )
activations = cache [ "resid_pre" , 8 ] # [batch, pos, d_model]
# 3. Encode to SAE features
sae_features = sae . encode ( activations ) # [batch, pos, d_sae]
print ( f"Active features: { ( sae_features > 0 ) . sum ( ) } " )
# 4. Find top features for each position
for pos in range ( tokens . shape [ 1 ] ) :
top_features = sae_features [ 0 , pos ] . topk ( 5 )
token = model . to_str_tokens ( tokens [ 0 , pos : pos + 1 ] ) [ 0 ]
print ( f"Token ' { token } ': features { top_features . indices . tolist ( ) } " )
# 5. Reconstruct activations
reconstructed = sae . decode ( sae_features )
reconstruction_error = ( activations - reconstructed ) . norm ( )

Workflow 3: Feature Analysis and Steering ​
Analyzing Individual Features ​
import torch
sae , _ , _ = SAE . from_pretrained (
# Find what activates a specific feature
feature_idx = 1234
test_texts = [
"The scientist conducted an experiment" ,
"I love chocolate cake" ,
"The code compiles successfully" ,
"Paris is beautiful in spring" ,
]
for text in test_texts :
tokens = model . to_tokens ( text )
features = sae . encode ( cache [ "resid_pre" , 8 ] )
activation = features [ 0 , : , feature_idx ] . max ( ) . item ( )
print ( f" { activation : .3f } : { text } " )
Feature Steering ​
def steer_with_feature ( model , sae , prompt , feature_idx , strength = 5.0 ) :
"""Add SAE feature direction to residual stream."""
tokens = model . to_tokens ( prompt )
# Get feature direction from decoder
feature_direction = sae . W_dec [ feature_idx ] # [d_model]
def steering_hook ( activation , hook ) :
# Add scaled feature direction at all positions
activation += strength * feature_direction
return activation
# Generate with steering
output = model . generate (
tokens ,
max_new_tokens = 50 ,
fwd_hooks = [ ( "blocks.8.hook_resid_pre" , steering_hook ) ]
return model . to_string ( output [ 0 ] )
Feature Attribution ​
# Which features most affect a specific output?
tokens = model . to_tokens ( "The capital of France is" )
# Get features at final position
features = sae . encode ( cache [ "resid_pre" , 8 ] ) [ 0 , - 1 ] # [d_sae]
# Get logit attribution per feature
# Feature contribution = feature_activation × decoder_weight × unembedding
W_dec = sae . W_dec # [d_sae, d_model]
W_U = model . W_U # [d_model, vocab]
# Contribution to "Paris" logit
paris_token = model . to_single_token ( " Paris" )
feature_contributions = features * ( W_dec @ W_U [ : , paris_token ] )
top_features = feature_contributions . topk ( 10 )
print ( "Top features for 'Paris' prediction:" )
for idx , val in zip ( top_features . indices , top_features . values ) :
print ( f" Feature { idx . item ( ) } : { val . item ( ) : .3f } " )
Common Issues & Solutions ​
Issue: High dead feature ratio ​
# WRONG: No warm-up, features die early
l1_coefficient = 1e-4 ,
l1_warm_up_steps = 0 , # Bad!
# RIGHT: Warm-up L1 penalty
l1_coefficient = 8e-5 ,
l1_warm_up_steps = 1000 , # Gradually increase
use_ghost_grads = True , # Revive dead features
Issue: Poor reconstruction (low CE recovery) ​
# Reduce sparsity penalty
l1_coefficient = 5e-5 , # Lower = better reconstruction
d_sae = 768 * 16 , # More capacity
Issue: Features not interpretable ​
# Increase sparsity (higher L1)
l1_coefficient = 1e-4 , # Higher = sparser, more interpretable
# Or use TopK architecture
architecture = "topk" ,
activation_fn_kwargs = { "k" : 50 } , # Exactly 50 active features
Issue: Memory errors during training ​
train_batch_size_tokens = 2048 , # Reduce batch size
store_batch_size_prompts = 4 , # Fewer prompts in buffer
n_batches_in_buffer = 8 , # Smaller activation buffer
