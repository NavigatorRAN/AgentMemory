## Description

The http adapter sends a JSON webhook request to a service you control. Use it when the runtime is remote, long-lived, or already exposed as an API instead of a local command.

HTTP
The http adapter sends a JSON webhook request to a service you control. Use it when the runtime is remote, long-lived, or already exposed as an API instead of a local command.
Info: http is a built-in internal adapter used by Paperclip's runtime. It's currently shown as "Coming soon" in the agent-config adapter-type dropdown and can't be selected manually. To target it today, configure the agent via the API or an imported company export.
When To Use
The agent runs in the cloud or behind another service.
You want Paperclip to trigger a webhook and let the remote service do the rest.
The runtime already expects a JSON body and returns a simple success or failure response.
When Not To Use
The runtime is just a local script or command. Use Process .
You need session persistence or built-in CLI behavior. Use one of the local adapters instead.
You need Paperclip to parse a rich stdout transcript from the remote runtime.
Common Fields
Field Required Notes url yes Absolute http:// or https:// endpoint. method no HTTP method to use. Defaults to POST . headers no Extra request headers. payloadTemplate no JSON object merged into the request body before the standard Paperclip fields are added. timeoutMs no Request timeout in milliseconds. 0 means no timeout.
Note: The HTTP adapter does not run a child process. It sends a single request, waits for the response, and treats any non-2xx response as a failure.
Request Body
Paperclip sends a JSON payload that always includes:
runId
agentId
context
Any payloadTemplate fields are merged in first, then Paperclip adds the standard fields above. If a key collides, the standard Paperclip field wins.
Example body shape:
{
"runId": "run-123",
"agentId": "agent-123",
"context": {
"taskId": "issue-123",
"wakeReason": "scheduled",
"commentId": null
},
"customField": "value"
}
Your service can use PAPERCLIP_API_URL and a Paperclip API key to call back into the control plane after it finishes.
Environment Test
The Test Environment button checks:
The URL is present and uses http or https .
The configured method is valid.
The endpoint responds to a quick HEAD probe when reachable.
If the probe fails in a private network, that can still be acceptable. The important part is whether the runtime can actually receive the production request.
Example
"adapterType": "http",
"adapterConfig": {
"url": "https://agent.example.com/paperclip/heartbeat",
"method": "POST",
"headers": {
"Authorization": "Bearer <shared-secret>"
"payloadTemplate": {
"source": "paperclip"
"timeoutMs": 10000
Practical Notes
Use a shared secret or header-based auth on the remote service.
Keep the endpoint idempotent when possible because retries are easier to support.
Return a 2xx response when the webhook was accepted, not when all follow-up work is complete.
