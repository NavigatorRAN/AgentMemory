The Proxmox Cluster file system (“pmxcfs”) is a database-driven file
system for storing configuration files, replicated in real time to all
cluster nodes using corosync . We use this to store all Proxmox VE related
configuration files.
Although the file system stores all data inside a persistent database on disk,
a copy of the data resides in RAM. This imposes restrictions on the maximum
size, which is currently 128 MiB. This is still enough to store the
configuration of several thousand virtual machines.
This system provides the following advantages:
Seamless replication of all configuration to all nodes in real time
Provides strong consistency checks to avoid duplicate VM IDs
Read-only when a node loses quorum
Automatic updates of the corosync cluster configuration to all nodes
Includes a distributed locking mechanism
POSIX Compatibility
The file system is based on FUSE, so the behavior is POSIX like. But
some feature are simply not implemented, because we do not need them:
You can just generate normal files and directories, but no symbolic
links, …
You can’t rename non-empty directories (because this makes it easier
to guarantee that VMIDs are unique).
You can’t change file permissions (permissions are based on paths)
O_EXCL creates were not atomic (like old NFS)
O_TRUNC creates are not atomic (FUSE restriction)
File Access Rights
All files and directories are owned by user root and have group
www-data . Only root has write permissions, but group www-data can
read most files. Files below the following paths are only accessible by root:
/etc/pve/priv/
/etc/pve/nodes/${NAME}/priv/
Technology
We use the Corosync Cluster Engine for
cluster communication, and SQlite for the
database file. The file system is implemented in user space using
FUSE .

Symbolic links
Certain directories within the cluster file system use symbolic links, in order
to point to a node’s own configuration files. Thus, the files pointed to in the
table below refer to different files on each node of the cluster.
local
nodes/<LOCAL_HOST_NAME>
lxc
nodes/<LOCAL_HOST_NAME>/lxc/
openvz
nodes/<LOCAL_HOST_NAME>/openvz/ (deprecated, removed soon)
qemu-server
nodes/<LOCAL_HOST_NAME>/qemu-server/
Special status files for debugging (JSON)
.version
File versions (to detect file modifications)
.members
Info about cluster members
.vmlist
List of all VMs
.clusterlog
Cluster log (last 50 entries)
.rrd
RRD data (most recent entries)
Enable/Disable debugging
You can enable verbose syslog messages with:
echo "1" >/etc/pve/.debug
And disable verbose syslog messages with:
echo "0" >/etc/pve/.debug
Recovery
If you have major problems with your Proxmox VE host, for example hardware
issues, it could be helpful to copy the pmxcfs database file
/var/lib/pve-cluster/config.db , and move it to a new Proxmox VE
host. On the new host (with nothing running), you need to stop the
pve-cluster service and replace the config.db file (required permissions
0600 ). Following this, adapt /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts according to the
lost Proxmox VE host, then reboot and check (and don’t forget your
VM/CT data).
Remove Cluster Configuration
The recommended way is to reinstall the node after you remove it from
your cluster. This ensures that all secret cluster/ssh keys and any
shared configuration data is destroyed.
In some cases, you might prefer to put a node back to local mode without
reinstalling, which is described in
Separate A Node Without Reinstalling
Recovering/Moving Guests from Failed Nodes
For the guest configuration files in nodes/<NAME>/qemu-server/ (VMs) and
nodes/<NAME>/lxc/ (containers), Proxmox VE sees the containing node <NAME> as the
owner of the respective guest. This concept enables the usage of local locks
instead of expensive cluster-wide locks for preventing concurrent guest
configuration changes.
As a consequence, if the owning node of a guest fails (for example, due to a power
outage, fencing event, etc.), a regular migration is not possible (even if all
the disks are located on shared storage), because such a local lock on the
(offline) owning node is unobtainable. This is not a problem for HA-managed
guests, as Proxmox VE’s High Availability stack includes the necessary
(cluster-wide) locking and watchdog functionality to ensure correct and
automatic recovery of guests from fenced nodes.
If a non-HA-managed guest has only shared disks (and no other local resources
which are only available on the failed node), a manual recovery
is possible by simply moving the guest configuration file from the failed
node’s directory in /etc/pve/ to an online node’s directory (which changes the
logical owner or location of the guest).
For example, recovering the VM with ID 100 from an offline node1 to another
node node2 works by running the following command as root on any member node
of the cluster:
mv /etc/pve/nodes/node1/qemu-server/100.conf /etc/pve/nodes/node2/qemu-server/
Before manually recovering a guest like this, make absolutely sure
that the failed source node is really powered off/fenced. Otherwise Proxmox VE’s
locking principles are violated by the mv command, which can have unexpected
consequences.
Guests with local disks (or other local resources which are only
available on the offline node) are not recoverable like this. Either wait for the
failed node to rejoin the cluster or restore such guests from backups.
