Capabilities Building plugins
Plugins extend OpenClaw without changing core. A plugin can add a messaging
channel, model provider, local CLI backend, agent tool, hook, media provider,
or another plugin-owned capability.
You do not need to add an external plugin to the OpenClaw repository. Publish
the package to ClawHub and users install it with:
bash Copy code openclaw plugins install clawhub:<package-name>
Bare package specs still install from npm during the launch cutover. Use the
clawhub: prefix when you want ClawHub resolution.
Requirements
Use Node 22.19 or newer and a package manager such as npm or pnpm .
Be familiar with TypeScript ESM modules.
For in-repo bundled plugin work, clone the repository and run pnpm install .
Source-checkout plugin development is pnpm-only because OpenClaw loads bundled
plugins from extensions/* workspace packages.
Choose the plugin shape
Channel plugin
Connect OpenClaw to a messaging platform.
Provider plugin
Add a model, media, search, fetch, speech, or realtime provider.
CLI backend plugin
Run a local AI CLI through OpenClaw model fallback.
Tool plugin
Register agent tools.
Quickstart
Build a minimal tool plugin by registering one required agent tool. This is the
shortest useful plugin shape and shows the package, manifest, entry point, and
local proof.
Create package metadata
package.json Copy code { "name" : "@myorg/openclaw-my-plugin" , "version" : "1.0.0" , "type" : "module" , "openclaw" : { "extensions" : [ "./index.ts" ] , "compat" : { "pluginApi" : ">=2026.3.24-beta.2" , "minGatewayVersion" : "2026.3.24-beta.2" } , "build" : { "openclawVersion" : "2026.3.24-beta.2" , "pluginSdkVersion" : "2026.3.24-beta.2" } } } openclaw.plugin.json Copy code { "id" : "my-plugin" , "name" : "My Plugin" , "description" : "Adds a custom tool to OpenClaw" , "contracts" : { "tools" : [ "my_tool" ] } , "activation" : { "onStartup" : true } , "configSchema" : { "type" : "object" , "additionalProperties" : false } }
Published external plugins should point runtime entries at built JavaScript
files. See SDK entry points for the full entry
point contract.
Every plugin needs a manifest, even when it has no config. Runtime tools
must appear in contracts.tools so OpenClaw can discover ownership without
eagerly loading every plugin runtime. Set activation.onStartup
intentionally. This example starts on Gateway startup.
Host-trusted plugin surfaces are also manifest-gated and require explicit
enablement for installed plugins. If an installed plugin registers
api.registerAgentToolResultMiddleware(...) , declare each target runtime in
contracts.agentToolResultMiddleware . If it registers
api.registerTrustedToolPolicy(...) , declare each policy id in
contracts.trustedToolPolicies . These declarations keep install-time
inspection and runtime registration aligned.
For every manifest field, see Plugin manifest .
Register the tool
index.ts Copy code import { Type } from "typebox" ; import { definePluginEntry } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/plugin-entry" ; export default definePluginEntry ({ id : "my-plugin" , name : "My Plugin" , description : "Adds a custom tool to OpenClaw" , register ( api ) { api. registerTool ({ name : "my_tool" , description : "Echo one input value" , parameters : Type . Object ({ input : Type . String () }), async execute ( _id, params ) { return { content : [{ type : "text" , text : `Got: ${params.input} ` }], }; }, }); }, });
Use definePluginEntry for non-channel plugins. Channel plugins use
defineChannelPluginEntry .
Test the runtime
For an installed or external plugin, inspect the loaded runtime:
bash Copy code openclaw plugins inspect my-plugin --runtime --json
If the plugin registers a CLI command, run that command too. For example,
a demo command should have an execution proof such as
openclaw demo-plugin ping .
For a bundled plugin in this repository, OpenClaw discovers source-checkout
plugin packages from the extensions/* workspace. Run the closest targeted
test:
bash Copy code pnpm test -- extensions/my-plugin/ pnpm check
Publish
Validate the package before publishing:
bash Copy code clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin --dry-run clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin
The canonical ClawHub snippets live in docs/snippets/plugin-publish/ .
Install
Install the published package through ClawHub:
bash Copy code openclaw plugins install clawhub:your-org/your-plugin
Registering tools
Tools can be required or optional. Required tools are always available when the
plugin is enabled. Optional tools require user opt-in.
typescript Copy code register ( api ) { api. registerTool ( { name : "workflow_tool" , description : "Run a workflow" , parameters : Type . Object ({ pipeline : Type . String () }), async execute ( _id, params ) { return { content : [{ type : "text" , text : params. pipeline }] }; }, }, { optional : true }, ); }
Every tool registered with api.registerTool(...) must also be declared in the
plugin manifest:
json Copy code { "contracts" : { "tools" : [ "workflow_tool" ] } , "toolMetadata" : { "workflow_tool" : { "optional" : true } } }
Users opt in with tools.allow :
json5 Copy code { tools : { allow : [ "workflow_tool" ] }, // or ["my-plugin"] for all tools from one plugin }
Optional tools control whether a tool is exposed to the model. Use
plugin permission requests when a tool
or hook should ask for approval after the model selects it and before the
action runs.
Use optional tools for side effects, unusual binaries, or capabilities that
should not be exposed by default. Tool names must not conflict with core tools;
conflicts are skipped and reported in plugin diagnostics. Malformed
registrations, including tool descriptors without parameters , are skipped and
reported the same way. Registered tools are typed functions the model can call
after policy and allowlist checks pass.
Tool factories receive a runtime-supplied context object. Use ctx.activeModel
when a tool needs to log, display, or adapt to the active model for the current
turn. The object can include provider , modelId , and modelRef . Treat it as
informational runtime metadata, not as a security boundary against the local
operator, installed plugin code, or a modified OpenClaw runtime. Sensitive local
tools should still require an explicit plugin or operator opt-in and fail closed
when active-model metadata is missing or unsuitable.
The manifest declares ownership and discovery; execution still calls the live
registered tool implementation. Keep toolMetadata.<tool>.optional: true
aligned with api.registerTool(..., { optional: true }) so OpenClaw can avoid
loading that plugin runtime until the tool is explicitly allowlisted.
Import conventions
Import from focused SDK subpaths:
typescript Copy code
Do not import from the deprecated root barrel:
Within your plugin package, use local barrel files such as api.ts and
runtime-api.ts for internal imports. Do not import your own plugin through an
SDK path. Provider-specific helpers should stay in the provider package unless
the seam is truly generic.
Custom Gateway RPC methods are an advanced entry point. Keep them on a
plugin-specific prefix; core admin namespaces such as config.* ,
exec.approvals.* , operator.admin.* , wizard.* , and update.* stay reserved
and resolve to operator.admin . The
openclaw/plugin-sdk/gateway-method-runtime bridge is reserved for plugin HTTP
routes that declare contracts.gatewayMethodDispatch: ["authenticated-request"] .
For the full import map, see Plugin SDK overview .
Pre-submission checklist
OPENCLAW_DOCS_MARKER:calloutOpen:Q2hlY2s
package.json has correct openclaw metadata
OPENCLAW_DOCS_MARKER:calloutClose:
openclaw.plugin.json manifest is present and valid
Entry point uses defineChannelPluginEntry or definePluginEntry
All imports use focused plugin-sdk/<subpath> paths
Check�׫��b��+�ˬzZ
jY�v�^�z-H2�zW��jh��<CB,� ����(D
Tests pass ( pnpm test -- <bundled-plugin-root>/my-plugin/ )
pnpm check passes (in-repo plugins)
Test against beta releases
Watch for GitHub release tags on openclaw/openclaw and subscribe via Watch > Releases . Beta tags look like v2026.3.N-beta.1 . You can also turn on notifications for the official OpenClaw X account @openclaw for release announcements.
Test your plugin against the beta tag as soon as it appears. The window before stable is typically only a few hours.
Post in your plugin's thread in the plugin-forum Discord channel after testing with either all good or what broke. If you do not have a thread yet, create one.
If something breaks, open or update an issue titled Beta blocker: <plugin-name> - <summary> and apply the beta-blocker label. Put the issue link in your thread.
Open a PR to main titled fix(<plugin-id>): beta blocker - <summary> and link the issue in both the PR and your Discord thread. Contributors cannot label PRs, so the title is the PR-side signal for maintainers and automation. Blockers with a PR get merged; blockers without one might ship anyway. Maintainers watch these threads during beta testing.
Silence means green. If you miss the window, your fix likely lands in the next cycle.
