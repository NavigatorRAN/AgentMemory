OAuth in OpenClaw: token exchange, storage, and multi-account patterns

Agents Fundamentals
OpenClaw supports "subscription auth" via OAuth for providers that offer it
(notably OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT OAuth) ). For Anthropic, the practical split
is now:
Anthropic API key : normal Anthropic API billing
Anthropic Claude CLI / subscription auth inside OpenClaw : Anthropic staff
told us this usage is allowed again
OpenAI Codex OAuth is explicitly supported for use in external tools like
OpenClaw.
OpenClaw stores both OpenAI API-key auth and ChatGPT/Codex OAuth under the
canonical provider id openai . Older openai-codex:* profile ids and
auth.order.openai-codex entries are legacy state repaired by
openclaw doctor --fix ; use openai:* profile ids and auth.order.openai for
new config.
For Anthropic in production, API key auth is the safer recommended path.
This page explains:
how the OAuth token exchange works (PKCE)
where tokens are stored (and why)
how to handle multiple accounts (profiles + per-session overrides)
OpenClaw also supports provider plugins that ship their own OAuth or API-key
flows. Run them via:
bash Copy code openclaw models auth login --provider < id >
The token sink (why it exists)
OAuth providers commonly mint a new refresh token during login/refresh flows. Some providers (or OAuth clients) can invalidate older refresh tokens when a new one is issued for the same user/app.
Practical symptom:
you log in via OpenClaw and via Claude Code / Codex CLI → one of them randomly gets "logged out" later
To reduce that, OpenClaw treats auth-profiles.json as a token sink :
the runtime reads credentials from one place
we can keep multiple profiles and route them deterministically
external CLI reuse is provider-specific: Codex CLI can bootstrap an empty
openai:default profile, but once OpenClaw has a local OAuth profile,
the local refresh token is canonical. If that local refresh token is rejected,
OpenClaw can use a usable same-account Codex CLI token as a runtime-only
fallback; other integrations can remain externally managed and re-read their
CLI auth store
status and startup paths that already know the configured provider set scope
external CLI discovery to that set, so an unrelated CLI login store is not
probed for a single-provider setup
Storage (where tokens live)
Secrets are stored in agent auth stores:
Auth profiles (OAuth + API keys + optional value-level refs): ~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json
Legacy compatibility file: ~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth.json
(static api_key entries are scrubbed when discovered)
Legacy import-only file (still supported, but not the main store):
~/.openclaw/credentials/oauth.json (imported into auth-profiles.json on first use)
All of the above also respect $OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR (state dir override). Full reference: /gateway/configuration
For static secret refs and runtime snapshot activation behavior, see Secrets Management .
When a secondary agent has no local auth profile, OpenClaw uses read-through
inheritance from the default/main agent store. It does not clone the main
agent's auth-profiles.json on read. OAuth refresh tokens are especially
sensitive: normal copy flows skip them by default because some providers rotate
or invalidate refresh tokens after use. Configure a separate OAuth login for an
agent when it needs an independent account.
Anthropic legacy token compatibility
Warning
Anthropic's public Claude Code docs say direct Claude Code use stays within
Claude subscription limits, and Anthropic staff told us OpenClaw-style Claude
CLI usage is allowed again. OpenClaw therefore treats Claude CLI reuse and
claude -p usage as sanctioned for this integration unless Anthropic
publishes a new policy.
For Anthropic's current direct-Claude-Code plan docs, see Using Claude Code
with your Pro or Max
plan
and Using Claude Code with your Team or Enterprise
plan .
If you want other subscription-style options in OpenClaw, see OpenAI
Codex , Qwen Cloud Coding
Plan , MiniMax Coding Plan ,
and Z.AI / GLM Coding Plan .
OpenClaw also exposes Anthropic setup-token as a supported token-auth path, but it now prefers Claude CLI reuse and claude -p when available.
Anthropic Claude CLI migration
OpenClaw supports Anthropic Claude CLI reuse again. If you already have a local
Claude login on the host, onboarding/configure can reuse it directly.
OAuth exchange (how login works)
OpenClaw's interactive login flows are implemented in openclaw/plugin-sdk/llm and wired into the wizards/commands.
Anthropic setup-token
Flow shape:
start Anthropic setup-token or paste-token from OpenClaw
OpenClaw stores the resulting Anthropic credential in an auth profile
model selection stays on anthropic/...
existing Anthropic auth profiles remain available for rollback/order control
OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT OAuth)
OpenAI Codex OAuth is explicitly supported for use outside the Codex CLI, including OpenClaw workflows.
The login command still uses the canonical OpenAI provider id:
bash Copy code openclaw models auth login --provider openai
Use --profile-id openai:<name> for multiple ChatGPT/Codex OAuth accounts in
one agent. Do not use openai-codex:<name> for new profiles. Doctor migrates
that older prefix to a collision-free openai:* profile id; run
openclaw models auth list --provider openai after repair before copying
profile ids into auth.order or /model ...@<profileId> .
Flow shape (PKCE):
generate PKCE verifier/challenge + random state
open https://auth.openai.com/oauth/authorize?...
try to capture callback on http://127.0.0.1:1455/auth/callback
if callback can't bind (or you're remote/headless), paste the redirect URL/code
exchange at https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token
extract accountId from the access token and store { access, refresh, expires, accountId }
Wizard path is openclaw onboard → auth choice openai .
Refresh + expiry
Profiles store an expires timestamp.
At runtime:
if expires is in the future → use the stored access token
if expired → refresh (under a file lock) and overwrite the stored credentials
if a secondary agent reads an inherited main-agent OAuth profile, refresh
writes back to the main agent store instead of copying the refresh token into
the secondary agent store
exception: some external CLI credentials stay externally managed; OpenClaw
re-reads those CLI auth stores instead of spending copied refresh tokens.
Codex CLI bootstrap is intentionally narrower: it seeds an empty
openai:default profile, then OpenClaw-owned refreshes keep the local
profile canonical. If the local Codex refresh fails and Codex CLI has a
usable token for the same account, OpenClaw may use that token for the current
runtime request without writing it back to auth-profiles.json .
The refresh flow is automatic; you generally don't need to manage tokens manually.
Multiple accounts (profiles) + routing
Two patterns:
1) Preferred: separate agents
If you want "personal" and "work" to never interact, use isolated agents (separate sessions + credentials + workspace):
bash Copy code openclaw agents add work openclaw agents add personal
Then configure auth per-agent (wizard) and route chats to the right agent.
2) Advanced: multiple profiles in one agent
auth-profiles.json supports multiple profile IDs for the same provider.
Pick which profile is used:
globally via config ordering ( auth.order )
per-session via /model ...@<profileId>
Example (session override):
/model Opus@anthropic:work
How to see what profile IDs exist:
openclaw channels list --json (shows auth[] )
