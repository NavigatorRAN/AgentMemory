LEARN MORE
The August integration Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] allows you to integrate your August and some Yale Access devices in Home Assistant.
For devices that use the Yale Home app, the Yale integration should be used instead.
To add the August hub to your Home Assistant instance, use this My button:
August can be auto-discovered by Home Assistant. If an instance was found,
it will be shown as Discovered . You can then set it up right away.
Manual configuration steps
If it wasn’t discovered automatically, don’t worry! You can set up a
manual integration entry:
Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
Go to Settings > Devices & services .
In the bottom right corner, select the
Add Integration button.
From the list, select August .
Follow the instructions on screen to complete the setup.
Device Requires Connect Bridge or Doorbell August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (Gen 4) no August Smart Lock Pro (Gen 3) yes August Smart Lock (Gen 2) yes August Smart Lock (Gen 1) no August Doorbell Cam (Gen 1, Gen2) no August View no Yale Assure Lock yes Yale Assure Lock 2 yes Yale Smart Safe yes
Other devices not listed above have not been tested and may not function as expected.
There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:
Doorbell
Lock
Note
Most devices will need either August Connect Bridge or Doorbell to connect to Home Assistant.
The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (Gen 4) uses different battery technology (lithium-ion) than the other locks. The battery charge value reported by the lock detail API has frequently been reported as incorrect for these models.
Other August locks expect to be powered by AA alkaline (non-rechargeable) batteries. Rechargeable batteries in these locks will result in incorrect reporting of battery charge.
While most entities can be updated via the push API, August/Yale does not offer a push API for some data, which means these entities will update slower:
Doorbell ding sensor (Doorman models only)
Lock Battery sensor
Lock Operation sensor
If you have an August Doorbell, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see following sensors:
Doorbell ding sensor
Doorbell motion sensor
Doorbell online sensor
If you have an August Smart Lock with DoorSense, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see the following sensors:
Door sensor
Buttons are created to wake locks from a deep sleep. If your lock is not reporting a status, it may be in a deep sleep, and the button can be used to wake it. Locks are not automatically woken from deep sleep to preserve battery life.
If you have an August doorbell or lock that has a built-in doorbell, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see the following event entities:
Motion
Not all models include motion sensors and support for locks with built-in doorbells is limited to Yale Doorman models type 7 and 10.
The august camera platform allows you to view the latest camera image (triggered by motion) by your August device in Home Assistant.
If you have an August Doorbell with a battery, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see the following sensors:
Doorbell Battery
If you have an August Smart Lock, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see the following sensors:
Lock Battery
Lock Operation
If you have an August Keypad, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see the following sensors:
Keypad Battery
The Yale Access Bluetooth integration provides local control over Bluetooth of many Yale Access locks and some August locks that use the same system.
For locks that support the Yale Access system, the August integration can keep your offline access keys up to date to ensure you can operate your lock over Bluetooth. The following requirements must be met for the offline key updates to work:
The August integration must support the lock.
The Yale Access Bluetooth integration must support the lock.
The Bluetooth integration must be active and functional.
The lock must be discoverable by the Yale Access Bluetooth integration .
The account logged in with the August integration must have the offline keys.
If you do not know which account has the offline keys, configure August integration with each different Owner account until you find the one that holds the keys. You may need to make a new owner account and grant the account access to your lock to force the keys to synchronize with the cloud service.
Ensure the lock is in range and discoverable by the Yale Access Bluetooth integration .
Using the lock operation sensors, you can detect when a user operates a lock and is physically present (not remote). The below automation example (added to automations.yaml ) will trigger when the user named “John Doe” in August locks or unlocks the door from the keypad (if present), via Bluetooth from their phone, or by auto-unlock. The state of the sensor will be the name of the party operating the lock as returned by August.
