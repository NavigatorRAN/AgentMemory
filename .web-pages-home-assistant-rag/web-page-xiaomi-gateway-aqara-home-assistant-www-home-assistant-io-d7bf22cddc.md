The Xiaomi Gateway (Aqara) integration Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] allows you to integrate Xiaomi Aqara-compatible devices into Home Assistant.
Note
There are two versions of the hub: v1 and v2.
v1 can be used with Home Assistant without any problems.
v2 might be less straightforward when it comes to enabling the local API. It might even require you to open up your device to do so. Xiaomi has suggested this is in the pipeline. If you have a Hub 2 and are experiencing issues, check out the troubleshooting section.

Open the cover.
Close the cover.
Stop the cover motion.
Move the cover to a specific position.
See the current position of the cover.
The light entity allows you to control the internal light of the Xiaomi gateway. The entity is called light.gateway_light_28ffffffffff . You can do the following:
Turn the light on and off.
Set the brightness.
Set the color using HS or RGB color coding.
The requirement is that you have set up Xiaomi aqara .
An Aqara lock cannot be controlled by Home Assistant. However, the lock entity allows you to view the following data:
The property changed_by provides the user/key ID of the last successful unlock.

Xiaomi Wireless Button
There are 3 versions of the Xiaomi Wireless button:
For the round shaped button, the available events are single , double , hold , long_click_press and long_click_release .
Aqara branded buttons are square shaped. Model WXKG11LM only supports single , double , long_click_press and hold events. WXKG12LM supports single , double , long_click_press and shake events.
For the Aqara versions, the delay between two clicks to generate a double-click must be larger than with the round button. Clicking too quickly generates a single-click event.

For an overview of every action across all integrations, see the actions reference .
This example plays the sound of a dog barking when the button is held down and stops the sound when the button is pressed once. Only works for the round button of the 1st generation.
Note: The sound will stop playing automatically when it has ended.
- alias : " Let a dog bark on long press" triggers : - trigger : event event_type : xiaomi_aqara.click event_data : entity_id : binary_sensor.switch_158d000xxxxxc2 click_type : long_click_press actions : - action : xiaomi_aqara.play_ringtone data : gw_mac : xxxxxxxxxxxx ringtone_id : 8 ringtone_vol : 8 - alias : " Stop barking immediately on single click" triggers : - trigger : event event_type : xiaomi_aqara.click event_data : entity_id : binary_sensor.switch_158d000xxxxxc2 click_type : single actions : - action : xiaomi_aqara.stop_ringtone data : gw_mac : xxxxxxxxxxxx
This example toggles the living room lamp on a double click of the button.
- alias : " Double Click to toggle living room lamp" triggers : - trigger : event event_type : xiaomi_aqara.click event_data : entity_id : binary_sensor.switch_158d000xxxxxc2 click_type : double actions : - action : light.toggle target : entity_id : light.living_room_lamp
If you run into trouble initializing the gateway with your app, try another smartphone. E.g., it didn’t work on an OnePlus 3, but it worked with a Nexus 5.
2017-08-20 16:51:19 ERROR ( SyncWorker_0 ) [ homeassistant.components.xiaomi] No gateway discovered
2017-08-20 16:51:20 ERROR ( MainThread ) [ homeassistant.setup] Setup failed for xiaomi: Component failed to initialize.
That means that Home Assistant is not getting any response from your Xiaomi gateway. Might be a local network problem or your firewall.
Make sure you have enabled LAN access .
Turn off the firewall on the system where Home Assistant is running.
Ensure your router supports multicast as this is a requirement of the Xiaomi Gateway.
Try to disable and then enable LAN access.
Hard reset the gateway: Press the button of the gateway 30 seconds and start again from scratch.
If you are using Home Assistant in Docker , make sure to use --net=host .
If you receive an {"error":"Invalid key"} in your log while trying to control the gateway light
You should generate the key again using an Android Phone or alternatively an emulator such as bluestacks . In some instances, there is an issue with keys being generated using the iOS application.
You need to make sure to have multicast support on your network. If you are running Home Assistant in a virtual machine (like Proxmox), try echo 0 >/sys/class/net/vmbr0/bridge/multicast_snooping on the host and restart the service or reboot the host.
If your gateway’s MAC address starts with 04:CF:8C or 7C:49:EB , there is a good chance that the required port 9898 is closed on your gateway and thus, this method doesn’t work. There are workarounds available online, however this requires soldering and working with electricity.
