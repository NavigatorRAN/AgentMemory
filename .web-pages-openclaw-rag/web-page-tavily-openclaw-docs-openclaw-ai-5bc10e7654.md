Capabilities Tools
Tavily is a search API designed for AI applications. OpenClaw exposes it in two ways:
as the web_search provider for the generic search tool
as explicit plugin tools: tavily_search and tavily_extract
Tavily returns structured results optimized for LLM consumption with configurable search depth, topic filtering, domain filters, AI-generated answer summaries, and content extraction from URLs (including JavaScript-rendered pages).
Property Value Plugin id tavily Package @openclaw/tavily-plugin Auth TAVILY_API_KEY or config apiKey Base URL https://api.tavily.com (default) Tools tavily_search , tavily_extract
Getting started
Install the plugin
bash Copy code openclaw plugins install @openclaw/tavily-plugin
Get an API key
Create a Tavily account at tavily.com , then generate an API key in the dashboard.
Configure the plugin and provider
json5 Copy code { plugins : { entries : { tavily : { enabled : true , config : { webSearch : { apiKey : "tvly-..." , // optional if TAVILY_API_KEY is set baseUrl : "https://api.tavily.com" , }, }, }, }, }, tools : { web : { search : { provider : "tavily" , }, }, }, }
Verify search runs

Tool reference
tavily_search
Use this when you want Tavily-specific search controls instead of generic web_search .
Parameter Type Constraints / default Description query string required Search query string. Keep under 400 characters. search_depth enum basic (default), advanced advanced is slower but higher relevance. topic enum general (default), news , finance Filter by topic family. max_results integer 1-20 Number of results. include_answer boolean default false Include a Tavily AI-generated answer summary. time_range enum day , week , month , year Filter results by recency. include_domains string array (none) Only include results from these domains. exclude_domains string array (none) Exclude results from these domains.
Search depth tradeoff:
Depth Speed Relevance Best for basic Faster High General-purpose queries (default). advanced Slower Highest Precision research and fact-finding.
tavily_extract
Use this to extract clean content from one or more URLs. Handles JavaScript-rendered pages and supports query-focused chunking for targeted extraction.
Parameter Type Constraints / default Description urls string array required, 1-20 URLs to extract content from. query string (optional) Rerank extracted chunks by relevance to this query. extract_depth enum basic (default), advanced Use advanced for JS-heavy pages, SPAs, or dynamic tables. chunks_per_source integer 1-5; requires query Chunks returned per URL. Errors if set without query . include_images boolean default false Include image URLs in results.
Extract depth tradeoff:
Depth When to use basic Simple pages. Try this first. advanced JS-rendered SPAs, dynamic content, tables.
Batch larger URL lists into multiple tavily_extract calls (max 20 per request). Use query plus chunks_per_source to get only relevant content instead of full pages.
Choosing the right tool
Need Tool Quick web search, no special options web_search Search with depth, topic, AI answers tavily_search Extract content from specific URLs tavily_extract
Note
The generic web_search tool with Tavily as provider supports query and count (up to 20 results). For Tavily-specific controls ( search_depth , topic , include_answer , domain filters, time range), use tavily_search instead.
Advanced configuration
API key resolution order
The Tavily client looks up its API key in this order:
plugins.entries.tavily.config.webSearch.apiKey (resolved through SecretRefs).
TAVILY_API_KEY from the gateway environment.
tavily_extract raises a setup error if neither is present.
Custom base URL
Override plugins.entries.tavily.config.webSearch.baseUrl if you front Tavily through a proxy. The default is https://api.tavily.com .
`chunks_per_source` requires `query`
tavily_extract rejects calls that pass chunks_per_source without a query . Tavily ranks chunks by query relevance, so the parameter is meaningless without one.
