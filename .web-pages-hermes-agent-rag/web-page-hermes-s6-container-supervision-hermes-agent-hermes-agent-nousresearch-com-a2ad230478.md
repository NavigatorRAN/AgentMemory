Hermes s6-overlay Container Supervision
When to use this skill ​
Load this skill when you're working on:
Adding or removing a static service in the Hermes Docker image (something that should be supervised at every container start, like the dashboard)
Diagnosing why a per-profile gateway isn't starting, restarting, or surviving docker restart
Understanding why the container's CMD is /opt/hermes/docker/main-wrapper.sh and how leading-dash args reach the user's program
Modifying cont-init.d boot scripts (UID remap, volume seeding, profile reconciliation)
Changing the rendered run-script for per-profile gateways (Phase 4)
If you're just running the Hermes Agent and want to use Docker, see website/docs/user-guide/docker.md instead.

Key files ​
Path Role Dockerfile s6-overlay install + cont-init.d wiring + ENTRYPOINT ["/init", "/opt/hermes/docker/main-wrapper.sh"] docker/stage2-hook.sh The "old entrypoint logic" — UID remap, chown, seed, skills sync. Runs as cont-init.d/01-hermes-setup. docker/cont-init.d/02-reconcile-profiles Calls hermes_cli.container_boot on every boot to restore profile gateway slots from the persistent volume. docker/main-wrapper.sh The container's CMD. Routes user args, drops to hermes via s6-setuidgid , exec's the chosen program. docker/s6-rc.d/main-hermes/run No-op sleep infinity — slot exists so the s6-rc user bundle is valid; main hermes runs as the CMD, not as a supervised service. docker/s6-rc.d/dashboard/run Conditional service — exec sleep infinity unless HERMES_DASHBOARD is truthy. docker/entrypoint.sh Back-compat shim that exec s the stage2 hook. External scripts that hard-coded the old entrypoint path still work. hermes_cli/service_manager.py S6ServiceManager : register_profile_gateway , unregister_profile_gateway , start/stop/restart/is_running , list_profile_gateways . hermes_cli/container_boot.py reconcile_profile_gateways() — walks persistent profiles, regenerates s6 slots, emits container-boot.log . hermes_cli/gateway.py::_dispatch_via_service_manager_if_s6 Intercepts hermes gateway start/stop/restart and routes to s6 when running in a container.
Why Architecture B (CMD as main program, not s6-supervised) ​
The original plan (v1–v3) called for main hermes to run as a supervised s6-rc service. Two real s6-overlay v3 mechanics blocked that:
cont-init.d scripts receive no CMD args — so the stage2 hook can't parse docker run <image> chat -q "hi" to set HERMES_ARGS for a service run script to consume.
/run/s6/basedir/bin/halt does NOT propagate the exit code written to /run/s6-linux-init-container-results/exitcode . Containers always exit 143 (SIGTERM) regardless. Confirmed by skarnet (s6 author) in issue #477 : "if you want a container shutdown, you need to either have your CMD exit, or, if you have no CMD, write the container exit code you want then call halt" .
So we use the s6-overlay-native CMD pattern: ENTRYPOINT ["/init", "/opt/hermes/docker/main-wrapper.sh"] . /init prepends the wrapper to user args automatically — so docker run <image> --version becomes /init main-wrapper.sh --version , and --version doesn't get intercepted by /init's POSIX shell. The wrapper drops to hermes via s6-setuidgid , then exec's the chosen program. The program's exit code becomes the container exit code, exactly matching the pre-s6 tini contract.
Trade-off: main hermes is unsupervised under s6. That exactly matches its behavior under tini (the pre-s6 image). Dashboard supervision is the only new guarantee — and per-profile gateways under /run/service/ get full supervision.
Quick recipes ​
Verify s6 is PID 1 in a running container ​
docker exec < c > sh -c 'cat /proc/1/comm; readlink /proc/1/exe'
# Expect: s6-svscan or init / /package/admin/s6/.../s6-svscan
Inspect a profile gateway service ​
# /command/ isn't on docker-exec PATH — use absolute path
docker exec < c > /command/s6-svstat /run/service/gateway- < name >
# "up (pid …) … seconds" → running
# "down (exitcode N) … seconds, normally up, want up, …" → s6 wants it up but the process keeps exiting (crash loop)
# "down … normally up, ready …" → user stopped it
Bring a service up/down manually ​
docker exec < c > /command/s6-svc -u /run/service/gateway- < name > # up
docker exec < c > /command/s6-svc -d /run/service/gateway- < name > # down
docker exec < c > /command/s6-svc -t /run/service/gateway- < name > # SIGTERM (restart)
Watch the cont-init reconciler log ​
docker exec < c > tail -n 50 /opt/data/logs/container-boot.log
# 2026-05-21T06:18:05+0000 profile=coder prior_state=running action=started
# 2026-05-21T06:18:05+0000 profile=writer prior_state=stopped action=registered
Add a new static service ​
Create docker/s6-rc.d/<name>/type with longrun\n and docker/s6-rc.d/<name>/run (use #!/command/with-contenv sh + # shellcheck shell=sh ).
Drop to hermes via s6-setuidgid hermes at the top of run (unless you specifically need root).
Create empty docker/s6-rc.d/<name>/dependencies.d/base so it waits for the base bundle.
Create empty docker/s6-rc.d/user/contents.d/<name> so it joins the user bundle.
The COPY docker/s6-rc.d/ in the Dockerfile picks it up automatically — no other changes.
Change the per-profile gateway run command ​
Edit S6ServiceManager._render_run_script in hermes_cli/service_manager.py . The function is also called by hermes_cli/container_boot.py::_register_service during boot reconciliation, so it's the single source of truth. Update the corresponding assertion in tests/hermes_cli/test_service_manager.py::test_s6_register_creates_service_dir_and_triggers_scan .
Run the docker test harness ​
docker build -t hermes-agent-harness:latest .
HERMES_TEST_IMAGE = hermes-agent-harness:latest scripts/run_tests.sh tests/docker/ -v
# Expect 19 passed, 0 xfailed against the s6 image
The harness lives in tests/docker/ and skips when Docker isn't available. The per-test timeout is bumped to 180s (see tests/docker/conftest.py ).
Common pitfalls ​
"command not found" via docker exec ​
/command/ (where s6-overlay puts its binaries) is on PATH only for processes spawned by the supervision tree — services, cont-init.d, main-wrapper.sh. docker exec <c> s6-svstat … will fail with "command not found"; always use the absolute path /command/s6-svstat . The hermes binary works because the Dockerfile adds /opt/hermes/.venv/bin to the runtime ENV PATH .
Profile directory ownership ​
The cont-init reconciler runs as hermes ( s6-setuidgid hermes in 02-reconcile-profiles ). If a profile dir ends up root-owned (e.g. because docker exec <c> hermes profile create … ran as root by default), the reconciler can't read SOUL.md and fails with PermissionError . Mitigation: stage2-hook.sh chowns $HERMES_HOME/profiles to hermes on every boot, idempotently. Don't remove that block.
Files written by docker exec are root-owned ​
docker exec defaults to root. Either pass --user hermes or rely on the stage2 chown sweep next reboot. Don't write files under $HERMES_HOME/profiles/<name>/ as root manually — the next reconcile pass will sweep them but in-flight operations may hit perm errors.
Service slot exists but s6-svstat says "s6-supervise not running" ​
The service directory is on tmpfs and was wiped on container restart. Either the cont-init reconciler hasn't run yet (give it a moment after docker restart ) or it failed. Check docker logs <c> | grep '02-reconcile' .
Gateway starts then immediately exits ( down (exitcode 1) in svstat) ​
Most likely the profile has no model or auth configured. The service slot is correct — the gateway itself is unconfigured. Run hermes -p <profile> setup first. The s6 supervisor will keep restarting it; that's the desired behavior (when you fix the config, the next attempt succeeds and stays up).
Reconciler skipped a profile ​
The reconciler keys on the presence of SOUL.md as the "real profile" marker. hermes profile create always seeds it. If a profile dir is missing SOUL.md (stray directory, partial restore, backup-in-progress), the reconciler skips it intentionally. Add a SOUL.md (even empty) to opt back in.
"Help, the container exits 143!" ​
Check whether something is invoking s6-svscanctl -t or /run/s6/basedir/bin/halt — both cause /init to begin stage 3 shutdown but return 143 (SIGTERM) rather than the desired exit code. This was the Phase 2 architecture pivot from A to B. For container shutdown with a real exit code, you must let the CMD (main-wrapper.sh) exit normally; do not try to control exit from a finish script.
