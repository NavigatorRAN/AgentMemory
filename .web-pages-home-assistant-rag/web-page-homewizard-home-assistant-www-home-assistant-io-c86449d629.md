Removing the integration
To remove an integration instance from Home Assistant
Integration for the HomeWizard platform. It can collect data locally from HomeWizard products and create them as sensors in Home Assistant. Use this integration to monitor your energy, gas, and water usage to optimize your energy consumption. The information collected by this integration can be used by the Energy dashboard .
P1 Meter : Sensors for power import/export, energy consumption (single or three phases), and information about your smart meter and gas (model: HWE-P1 ).
Energy Socket : Sensors for power import/export and energy consumption, and switches for controlling the outlet (model: HWE-SKT ).
Watermeter : Sensors for active and total water usage (model: HWE-WTR ).
kWh Meter 1-Phase : Sensors for power import/export and energy consumption (model: HWE-KWH1 , SDM230-wifi )..
kWh Meter 3-Phase : Sensors for power import/export and energy consumption (models: HWE-KWH3 , SDM630-wifi ).
Plug-In Battery : Sensors for power import/export, energy consumption, production, and state of charge (model: HWE-BAT ).
You have to enable the local API to allow Home Assistant to communicate with your device. Do this in the HomeWizard app:
Tip
You can skip this step if you are configuring one of the following devices:
These products use a different authentication method that doesn’t require enabling the local API.
Go to Settings (gear icon in the upper-right).
Go to Meters .
Select your device.
Scroll down and turn on Local API .
To add the HomeWizard device to your Home Assistant instance, use this My button:
HomeWizard can be auto-discovered by Home Assistant. If an instance was found,
it will be shown as Discovered . You can then set it up right away.
Manual configuration steps
If it wasn’t discovered automatically, don’t worry! You can set up a
manual integration entry:
Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
Go to Settings > Devices & services .
In the bottom right corner, select the
Add Integration button.
From the list, select HomeWizard .
Follow the instructions on screen to complete the setup.

The HomeWizard integration provides sensors about what your device is measuring or doing. All of them are provided as entities An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service. [Learn more] in Home Assistant. Below is an overview of the entities provided by this integration.
Not all sensors are provided by all Smart Meters, only the available sensors are shown in the integration.
Energy import/export (kWh) : Total energy imported or exported since installation of your smart meter. Each tariff has its own sensor (e.g., T1, T2) and a sensor for the combined value.
Power (W) : Active consumed power measured, each phase has its own sensor. The sensors reading will negative if the power is generated.
Voltage (V) : Active voltage measured, each phase has its own sensor.
Current (A) : Active current measured, each phase has its own sensor.
Tariff : Current tariff that is used. Can be used to keep consumption as low as possible during peak hours.
Frequency (Hz) : Grid frequency.
Voltage sags and swells : Number of times a voltage sag or swell has been detected.
Power failures : Two sensors indicate the number of power failures detected by the smart meter. One for all power failures and another for ‘long’ power failures.
Peak demand : Belgium users are charged for the peak usage per month (see capaciteitstarief ). Two sensors are available: one shows the current quarterly average, and another shows the peak measured this month. Both sensors are provided directly from the smart meter and can be used to keep the peak as low as possible.
Status light brightness : Controls the brightness of the green status light. Error statuses are always visualized, even when the brightness is set to 0.
External meters, like a gas or water meter, can be connected to your Smart meter. Each device is exposed as a separate device A device is a model representing a physical or logical unit that contains entities. with its own measurement.
Energy import/export (kWh) : Total energy imported or exported measured by kWh meter.
Power (W) : Active consumed power that is measured, each phase has its own sensor. The sensors reading will negative if the power is generated.
Production power (W) : Active production power measured. The reading will negative if the power is consumed. This sensor can be used in the energy dashboard as solar production power sensor.
Reactive power (VAR) : Active reactive power measurement, each phase has its own sensor.
Apparent power (VA) : Active apparent power measurement, each phase has its own sensor.
Energy import/export (kWh) : Total energy imported or exported measured by Energy Socket.
Power (W) : Active power that is measured. The sensors reading will negative if the power is generated.
Voltage (V) : Active voltage measured.
Current (A) : Active current measured.
Reactive power (VAR) *: Active reactive power measurement.
Apparent power (VA) *: Active apparent power measurement.
Note
Reactive power and apparent power are not available for all hardware versions, this depends on the internal metering chip.
The Energy Socket also has a switch to control the outlet state and a status light that can be controlled.
Switch : Controls the outlet state of the Energy Socket. This switch is permanently on when Switch Lock is turned on. Use this to control the power of simple devices, such as a heater or a charger.
Switch lock : Forces the outlet state to the on position and disables the physical button. This option is useful when the socket is used for a device that must not be turned off, such as a refrigerator.
Status light brightness : Controls the brightness of the green status light. This light turns on when the switch is on.
Water usage (L/min) : Flow of water measured at that time.
Total water usage (m³) : Total water usage since the installation of the Watermeter.
Energy import/export (kWh) : Total energy imported or exported by the battery.
Power (W) : Active power consumed or produced by the battery. The sensors reading will negative if the power is generated.
Production power (W) : Active production power measured. The sensors reading will negative if the power is consumed. This sensor is to be used in the energy dashboard as battery power sensor.
Current (A) : Active current consumed or produced by the battery.
Cycles : Number of charge cycles the battery has gone through.
State of charge (%) : The current state of charge of the battery.
Status light brightness : Controls the brightness of the LED strip. Error statuses are always visualized, even when the brightness is set to 0.
The Plug-In Battery provides some special group-level entities to help you manage your batteries:
Battery group charging strategy : Lets you control how your group of Plug-In Batteries charges and discharges.
Battery group power : Shows the total power consumed or produced by the group of connected Plug-In Batteries.
Battery group target power : Shows the target power the group is trying to achieve.
You can find these entities on the device that manages your batteries. This is either your P1 Meter or kWh Meter, depending on which is set as your mains connection in the HomeWizard app. These entities are not available directly on the battery itself. If you add Plug-In Batteries after your initial setup, these entities may be disabled by default. For information on how to enable them, see I can’t find entities like voltage, current, battery group charging strategy, or battery group target power .
Battery group charging strategy
The group of connected Plug-In Batteries can be controlled in different modes using the Battery group charging strategy select entity:
Net zero : In this charging strategy, the Plug-In Battery works to keep your home’s net power consumption or production as close to zero as possible. The battery will automatically charge or discharge to maintain a balanced power flow. This is the default setting and helps you maximize self-consumption and minimize grid interaction.
Net zero (charge only) : The Plug-In Battery will only charge to absorb excess solar production, aiming to keep your home’s power production at zero. Discharging is disabled in this mode. This is useful if you want to store solar energy for later use, such as during the evening or when energy prices are higher.
Net zero (discharge only) : The Plug-In Battery will only discharge to supply power when your home’s consumption exceeds solar production, aiming to keep your home’s power consumption at zero. Charging is disabled in this mode. This can be helpful when energy prices are high and you prefer to use stored energy or sell excess solar production to the grid.
One-time full charge : All connected Plug-In Batteries will be charged to 100%, regardless of the power consumption/production of your home. When all batteries are fully charged, the Plug-In Battery will switch to the standby mode.
Standby : Plug-In Batteries will enter standby mode. This means that the Plug-In Battery will neither charge nor discharge.
Smart charging : With this strategy, the Plug-In Batteries continuously predict the best moments to charge and discharge based on your production, consumption, and the local weather. This helps keep the grid in your area more stable and sustainable, and lets you save extra with a dynamic energy contract. Note: Smart charging requires a cloud connection for requesting a prediction plan.

Smart charging is available for the following devices:
P1 Meter with firmware version 6.0400 or higher
kWh Meter with firmware version 5.0200 or higher
To learn how to update your device to the latest version, see How do I check if I have the latest software on my HomeWizard product?
Battery group power and battery group target power
The Battery group power entity shows the total power consumed or produced by the group of connected Plug-In Batteries. The Battery group target power entity shows the target power for the battery group, as determined by the current battery group charging strategy. These values is expressed in watts (W). A negative value means the battery group is trying to produce power, while a positive value means the battery group is trying to consume power.
The identify button can be pressed to let the status light blink for a few seconds.
This feature is not available for the kWh Meter.
The HomeWizard devices are designed to work with the HomeWizard app and require communication with the HomeWizard cloud to function with the app. The “Cloud connection” configuration toggle can be used to turn off all communication with the HomeWizard cloud, making the device fully local. The device cannot communicate with the app, and the device won’t receive any future firmware updates.
This feature is not available for the Plug-In Battery. Cloud communication is restored when the switch is turned on again. Cloud communications are also restored after a factory reset, or when the device is put in pairing mode.
If you know the energy characteristics of your washing machine, you can create an automation that sends a notification when the energy usage drops below a certain threshold. This can notify you when your washing machine is done. You can use the following blueprint for this:
Appliance Power Monitor Blueprint With Elapsed Time and Energy Used Variables , created by @Jhonattan-Souza
The HomeWizard integration provides data that can be used in the Energy dashboard. To add your data to the Energy dashboard, follow the steps in the Energy dashboard documentation .
The integration is polling Data polling is the process of querying a device or service at regular intervals to check for updates or retrieve data. By defining a custom polling interval, you can control how frequently your system checks for new data, which can help optimize performance and reduce unnecessary network traffic. [Learn more] new data every 5 seconds. There is no limitation on the number or frequency of requests that can be made to the device.
If you want to define a specific interval at which your device is being polled for data, you can disable the default polling interval and create your own polling automation.
To add the automation:
Go to Settings > Devices & services , and select your integration.
On the integration entry, select the .
Then, select System options and toggle the button to disable polling.
To define your custom polling interval, create an automation.
Go to Settings > Automations & scenes and create a new automation.
Define any trigger and condition you like.
Select Add action , then select Other actions .
Select Perform action , and from the list, select the homeassistant.update_entity action .
Add the entities you want to poll to the Entity field. The homeassistant.update_entity action only supports targeting by entity. Selecting an area, device, or label is not supported.
Save your new automation to poll for data.
The Watermeter can be powered via a USB-C cable and with batteries. When using batteries, it only connects to Wi-Fi every couple of hours. Because of this, the API can only be used when powered via the USB-C cable. It is not possible to use this integration when the Watermeter is powered by batteries.
The P1 Meter is updated by the smart meter, which usually updates every 1 or 10 seconds. This means that the P1 Meter may not update as fast as the other devices.
It may happen that you can’t find your devices or they won’t show up in the integration setup. This can be caused by the following:
The device is not connected to the network. You have to connect your new device to the network first via the HomeWizard app.
Make sure you have updated the device to the latest firmware. Follow this guide to learn how to update your device: How do I check if I have the latest software on my HomeWizard product?
Make sure you have enabled the local API in device settings via the HomeWizard app.
Make sure both Home Assistant and the device are on the same network.
During setup, you may be asked to press a button on your device to authenticate it with Home Assistant.
P1 Meter : Press the white button on the front of the P1 Meter.
Plug-In Battery : Press the black touch button on the front of the device. You will hear a beep.
kWh Meter : Press and hold the button with the Wi‑Fi icon for two seconds. Release the button before the display shows “AP”.
Energy Socket and Watermeter : they do not require this step.
After pressing the button, you must select Continue within 30 seconds to complete the setup.
If the setup times out, you may need to press the button again.
Some entities are disabled by default. You can enable them in the integration setup. See the enabling or disabling entities documentation for more information.
This integration follows standard integration removal.
