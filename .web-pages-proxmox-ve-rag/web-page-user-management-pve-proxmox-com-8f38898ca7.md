Proxmox VE supports multiple authentication sources, for example Linux PAM,
an integrated Proxmox VE authentication server, LDAP, Microsoft Active
Directory and OpenID Connect.
By using role-based user and permission management for all objects (VMs,
Storage, nodes, etc.), granular access can be defined.
Users
Proxmox VE stores user attributes in /etc/pve/user.cfg .
Passwords are not stored here; users are instead associated with the
authentication realms described below.
Therefore, a user is often internally identified by their username and
realm in the form <userid>@<realm> .
Each user entry in this file contains the following information:
First name
Last name
E-mail address
Group memberships
An optional expiration date
A comment or note about this user
Whether this user is enabled or disabled
Optional two-factor authentication keys
When you disable or delete a user, or if the expiry date set is
in the past, this user will not be able to log in to new sessions or start new
tasks. All tasks which have already been started by this user (for example,
terminal sessions) will not be terminated automatically by any such event.
System administrator
The system’s root user can always log in via the Linux PAM realm and is an
unconfined administrator. This user cannot be deleted, but attributes can
still be changed. System mails will be sent to the email address
assigned to this user.
Groups
Each user can be a member of several groups. Groups are the preferred
way to organize access permissions. You should always grant permissions
to groups instead of individual users. That way you will get a
much more maintainable access control list.
API Tokens
API tokens allow stateless access to most parts of the REST API from another
system, software or API client. Tokens can be generated for individual users
and can be given separate permissions and expiration dates to limit the scope
and duration of the access. Should the API token get compromised, it can be
revoked without disabling the user itself.
API tokens come in two basic types:
Separated privileges: The token needs to be given explicit access with ACLs.
Its effective permissions are calculated by intersecting user and token
permissions. This is the default for newly created tokens.
Full privileges: The token’s permissions are identical to that of the
associated user. Disable Privilege Separation only when the integration
genuinely needs the user’s full permissions.
Set an expire timestamp (Unix epoch seconds) when creating a token so
that abandoned automation does not silently keep working. The
authentication code refuses requests once the deadline has passed.
The token value is only displayed/returned once when the token is
generated. It cannot be retrieved again over the API at a later time!
To use an API token, set the HTTP header Authorization to the displayed value
of the form PVEAPIToken=USER@REALM!TOKENID=UUID when making API requests, or
refer to your API client’s documentation.
Resource Pools
A resource pool is a set of virtual machines, containers, and storage
devices. It is useful for permission handling in cases where certain users
should have controlled access to a specific set of resources, as it allows for a
single permission to be applied to a set of elements, rather than having to
manage this on a per-resource basis. Resource pools are often used in tandem
with groups, so that the members of a group have permissions on a set of
machines and storage.
Authentication Realms
As Proxmox VE users are just counterparts for users existing on some external
realm, the realms have to be configured in /etc/pve/domains.cfg .
The following realms (authentication methods) are available:
Linux PAM Standard Authentication
Linux PAM is a framework for system-wide user authentication. These users are
created on the host system with commands such as adduser . If PAM users exist
on the Proxmox VE host system, corresponding entries can be added to Proxmox VE, to allow
these users to log in via their system username and password.
Proxmox VE Authentication Server
This is a Unix-like password store, which stores hashed passwords in
/etc/pve/priv/shadow.cfg . Passwords are hashed using the SHA-256 hashing
algorithm. This is the most convenient realm for small-scale (or even
mid-scale) installations, where users do not need access to anything outside of
Proxmox VE. In this case, users are fully managed by Proxmox VE and are able to change
their own passwords via the GUI.
LDAP
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an open, cross-platform protocol
for authentication using directory services. OpenLDAP is a popular open-source
implementations of the LDAP protocol.
Microsoft Active Directory (AD)
Microsoft Active Directory (AD) is a directory service for Windows domain
networks and is supported as an authentication realm for Proxmox VE. It supports LDAP
as an authentication protocol.
OpenID Connect
OpenID Connect is implemented as an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the user, based on
authentication performed by an external authorization server.
As Linux PAM corresponds to host system users, a system user must exist on each
node which the user is allowed to log in on. The user authenticates with their
usual system password. This realm is added by default and can’t be removed.
Password changes via the GUI or, equivalently, the /access/password API
endpoint only apply to the local node and not cluster-wide. Even though Proxmox VE
has a multi-master design, using different passwords for different nodes can
still offer a security benefit.
In terms of configurability, an administrator can choose to require two-factor
authentication with logins from the realm and to set the realm as the default
authentication realm.
The Proxmox VE authentication server realm is a simple Unix-like password store.
The realm is created by default, and as with Linux PAM, the only configuration
items available are the ability to require two-factor authentication for users
of the realm, and to set it as the default realm for login.
Unlike the other Proxmox VE realm types, users are created and authenticated entirely
through Proxmox VE, rather than authenticating against another system. Hence, you are
required to set a password for this type of user upon creation.
You can also use an external LDAP server for user authentication (for example,
OpenLDAP). In this realm type, users are searched under a Base Domain Name
( base_dn ), using the username attribute specified in the User Attribute Name
( user_attr ) field.
A server and optional fallback server can be configured, and the connection can
be encrypted via SSL. Furthermore, filters can be configured for directories and
groups. Filters allow you to further limit the scope of the realm.
For instance, if a user is represented via the following LDIF dataset:
# user1 of People at ldap-test.com
dn: uid=user1,ou=People,dc=ldap-test,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
uid: user1
cn: Test User 1
sn: Testers
description: This is the first test user.
The Base Domain Name would be ou=People,dc=ldap-test,dc=com and the user
attribute would be uid .
If Proxmox VE needs to authenticate (bind) to the LDAP server before being
able to query and authenticate users, a bind domain name can be
configured via the bind_dn property in /etc/pve/domains.cfg . Its
password then has to be stored in /etc/pve/priv/realm/<realmname>.pw
(for example, /etc/pve/priv/realm/my-ldap.pw ). This file should contain a
single line with the raw password.
To verify certificates, you need to set capath . You can set it either
directly to the CA certificate of your LDAP server, or to the system path
containing all trusted CA certificates ( /etc/ssl/certs ).
Additionally, you need to set the verify option, which can also be done over
the web interface.
The main configuration options for an LDAP server realm are as follows:
Realm ( realm ): The realm identifier for Proxmox VE users
Base Domain Name ( base_dn ): The directory which users are searched under
User Attribute Name ( user_attr ): The LDAP attribute containing the
username that users will log in with
Server ( server1 ): The server hosting the LDAP directory
Fallback Server ( server2 ): An optional fallback server address, in case
the primary server is unreachable
Port ( port ): The port that the LDAP server listens on
In order to allow a particular user to authenticate using the LDAP server,
you must also add them as a user of that realm from the Proxmox VE server. This can
be carried out automatically with syncing .
To set up Microsoft AD as a realm, a server address and authentication domain
need to be specified. Active Directory supports most of the same properties as
LDAP, such as an optional fallback server, port, and SSL encryption.
Furthermore, users can be added to Proxmox VE automatically via
sync operations, after configuration.
As with LDAP, if Proxmox VE needs to authenticate before it binds to the AD server,
you must configure the Bind User ( bind_dn ) property. This property is
typically required by default for Microsoft AD.
The main configuration settings for Microsoft Active Directory are:
Domain ( domain ): The AD domain of the server
Server ( server1 ): The FQDN or IP address of the server
Port ( port ): The port that the Microsoft AD server listens on
Microsoft AD normally checks values like usernames without case
sensitivity. To make Proxmox VE do the same, you can disable the default
case-sensitive option by editing the realm in the web UI, or using the CLI
(change the ID with the realm ID):
pveum realm modify ID --case-sensitive 0
Syncing LDAP-Based Realms
It’s possible to automatically sync users and groups for LDAP-based realms (LDAP
& Microsoft Active Directory), rather than having to add them to Proxmox VE manually.
You can access the sync options from the Add/Edit window of the web interface’s
Authentication panel or via the pveum realm add/modify commands. You can
then carry out the sync operation from the Authentication panel of the GUI or
using the following command:
pveum realm sync <realm>
Users and groups are synced to the cluster-wide configuration file,
/etc/pve/user.cfg .
Attributes to Properties
If the sync response includes user attributes, they will be synced into the
matching user property in the user.cfg . For example: firstname or
lastname .
If the names of the attributes are not matching the Proxmox VE properties, you can
set a custom field-to-field map in the config by using the sync_attributes
option.
How such properties are handled if anything vanishes can be controlled via the
sync options, see below.
Sync Configuration
The configuration options for syncing LDAP-based realms can be found in the
Sync Options tab of the Add/Edit window.
The configuration options are as follows:
Bind User ( bind_dn ): Refers to the LDAP account used to query users
and groups. This account needs access to all desired entries. If it’s set, the
search will be carried out via binding; otherwise, the search will be carried
out anonymously. The user must be a complete LDAP formatted distinguished name
(DN), for example, cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com .
Groupname attr. (group_name_attr): Represents the
users' groups. Only entries which adhere to the usual character limitations of
the user.cfg are synced. Groups are synced with -$realm attached to the
name, in order to avoid naming conflicts. Please ensure that a sync does not
overwrite manually created groups.
User classes ( user_classes ): Objects classes associated with users.
Group classes ( group_classes ): Objects classes associated with groups.
E-Mail attribute : If the LDAP-based server specifies user email addresses,
these can also be included in the sync by setting the associated attribute
here. From the command line, this is achievable through the
--sync_attributes parameter.
User Filter ( filter ): For further filter options to target specific users.
Group Filter ( group_filter ): For further filter options to target specific
groups.
Filters allow you to create a set of additional match criteria, to narrow
down the scope of a sync. Information on available LDAP filter types and their
usage can be found at ldap.com .
Sync Options
In addition to the options specified in the previous section, you can also
configure further options that describe the behavior of the sync operation.
These options are either set as parameters before the sync, or as defaults via
the realm option sync-defaults-options .
The main options for syncing are:
Scope ( scope ): The scope of what to sync. It can be either users ,
groups or both .
Enable new ( enable-new ): If set, the newly synced users are enabled and
can log in. The default is true .
Remove Vanished ( remove-vanished ): This is a list of options which, when
activated, determine if they are removed when they are not returned from
the sync response. The options are:
ACL ( acl) : Remove ACLs of users and groups which were not returned
returned in the sync response. This most often makes sense together with
Entry .
Entry ( entry ): Removes entries (i.e. users and groups) when they are
not returned in the sync response.
Properties ( properties ): Removes properties of entries where the user
in the sync response did not contain those attributes. This includes
all properties, even those never set by a sync. Exceptions are tokens
and the enable flag, these will be retained even with this option enabled.
Preview ( dry-run ): No data is written to the config. This is useful if you
want to see which users and groups would get synced to the user.cfg .
Reserved characters
Certain characters are reserved (see RFC2253 ) and cannot be
easily used in attribute values in DNs without being escaped properly.
Following characters need escaping:
Space ( ) at the beginning or end
Number sign ( # ) at the beginning
Comma ( , )
Plus sign ( + )
Double quote ( " )
Forward slashes ( / )
Angle brackets ( <> )
Semicolon ( ; )
Equals sign ( = )
To use such characters in DNs, surround the attribute value in double quotes.
For example, to bind with a user with the CN (Common Name) Example, User , use
CN="Example, User",OU=people,DC=example,DC=com as value for bind_dn .
This applies to the base_dn , bind_dn , and group_dn attributes.
Users with colons and forward slashes cannot be synced since these are
reserved characters in usernames.
The main OpenID Connect configuration options are:
Issuer URL ( issuer-url ): This is the URL of the authorization server.
Proxmox VE uses the OpenID Connect Discovery protocol to automatically configure
further details.
While it is possible to use unencrypted http:// URLs, we strongly recommend to
use encrypted https:// connections.
Client ID ( client-id ): OpenID Client ID.
Client Key ( client-key ): Optional OpenID Client Key.
Autocreate Users ( autocreate ): Automatically create users if they do not
exist. While authentication is done at the OpenID server, all users still need
an entry in the Proxmox VE user configuration. You can either add them manually, or
use the autocreate option to automatically add new users.
Username Claim ( username-claim ): OpenID claim used to generate the unique
username ( subject , username or email ).
Autocreate Groups ( groups-autocreate ): Create all groups in the claim
instead of using existing PVE groups (default behavior).
Groups Claim ( groups-claim ): OpenID claim used to retrieve the groups from
the ID token or userinfo endpoint.
Overwrite Groups ( groups-overwrite ): Overwrite all groups assigned to user
instead of appending to existing groups (default behavior).
Username mapping
The OpenID Connect specification defines a single unique attribute
( claim in OpenID terms) named subject . By default, we use the
value of this attribute to generate Proxmox VE usernames, by simple adding
@ and the realm name: ${subject}@${realm} .
Unfortunately, most OpenID servers use random strings for subject , like
DGH76OKH34BNG3245SB , so a typical username would look like
DGH76OKH34BNG3245SB@yourrealm . While unique, it is difficult for
humans to remember such random strings, making it quite impossible to
associate real users with this.
The username-claim setting allows you to use other attributes for
the username mapping. Setting it to username is preferred if the
OpenID Connect server provides that attribute and guarantees its
uniqueness.
Another option is to use email , which also yields human readable
usernames. Again, only use this setting if the server guarantees the
uniqueness of this attribute.
Groups mapping
Specifying the groups-claim setting in the OpenID configuration enables group
mapping functionality. The data provided in the groups-claim should be
a list of strings that correspond to groups that a user should be a member of in
Proxmox VE. To prevent collisions, group names from the OpenID claim are suffixed
with -<realm name> (e.g. for the OpenID group name my-openid-group in the
realm oidc , the group name in Proxmox VE would be my-openid-group-oidc ).
Any groups reported by the OpenID provider that do not exist in Proxmox VE are
ignored by default. If all groups reported by the OpenID provider should exist
in Proxmox VE, the groups-autocreate option may be used to automatically create
these groups on user logins.
By default, groups are appended to the user’s existing groups. It may be
desirable to overwrite any groups that the user is already a member in Proxmox VE
with those from the OpenID provider. Enabling the groups-overwrite setting
removes all groups from the user in Proxmox VE before adding the groups reported by
the OpenID provider.
In some cases, OpenID servers may send groups claims which include invalid
characters for Proxmox VE group IDs. Any groups that contain characters not allowed
in a Proxmox VE group name are not included and a warning will be sent to the logs.
Advanced settings
Query userinfo endpoint ( query-userinfo ): Enabling this option requires
the OpenID Connect authenticator to query the "userinfo" endpoint for claim
values. Disabling this option is useful for some identity providers that do not
support the "userinfo" endpoint (e.g. ADFS).
Examples
Here is an example of creating an OpenID realm using Google. You need to
replace --client-id and --client-key with the values
from your Google OpenID settings.
pveum realm add myrealm1 --type openid --issuer-url https://accounts.google.com --client-id XXXX --client-key YYYY --username-claim email
The above command uses --username-claim email , so that the usernames on the
Proxmox VE side look like example.user@google.com@myrealm1 .
Keycloak ( https://www.keycloak.org/ ) is a popular open source Identity
and Access Management tool, which supports OpenID Connect. In the following
example, you need to replace the --issuer-url and --client-id with
your information:
pveum realm add myrealm2 --type openid --issuer-url https://your.server:8080/realms/your-realm --client-id XXX --username-claim username
Using --username-claim username enables simple usernames on the
Proxmox VE side, like example.user@myrealm2 .
You need to ensure that the user is not allowed to edit
the username setting themselves (on the Keycloak server).
Two-Factor Authentication
There are two ways to use two-factor authentication:
It can be required by the authentication realm, either via TOTP
(Time-based One-Time Password) or YubiKey OTP . In this case, a newly
created user needs to have their keys added immediately, as there is no way to
log in without the second factor. In the case of TOTP , users can
also change the TOTP later on, provided they can log in first.
Alternatively, users can choose to opt-in to two-factor authentication
later on, even if the realm does not enforce it.
Available Second Factors
You can set up multiple second factors, in order to avoid a situation in
which losing your smartphone or security key locks you out of your
account permanently.
The following two-factor authentication methods are available in
addition to realm-enforced TOTP and YubiKey OTP:
User configured TOTP
( Time-based One-Time Password ).
A short code derived from a shared secret and the current time, it changes
every 30 seconds.
WebAuthn ( Web Authentication ).
A general standard for authentication. It is implemented by various
security devices, like hardware keys or trusted platform modules (TPM)
from a computer or smart phone.
Single use Recovery Keys. A list of keys which should either be
printed out and locked in a secure place or saved digitally in an
electronic vault. Each key can be used only once. These are perfect for
ensuring that you are not locked out, even if all of your other second
factors are lost or corrupt.
Before WebAuthn was supported, U2F could be setup by the user. Existing
U2F factors can still be used, but it is recommended to switch to
WebAuthn, once it is configured on the server.
Realm Enforced Two-Factor Authentication
This can be done by selecting one of the available methods via the
TFA dropdown box when adding or editing an Authentication Realm.
When a realm has TFA enabled, it becomes a requirement, and only users
with configured TFA will be able to log in.
Currently there are two methods available:
Time-based OATH (TOTP)
This uses the standard HMAC-SHA1 algorithm,
where the current time is hashed with the user’s configured key. The
time step and password length parameters are configurable.
A user can have multiple keys configured (separated by spaces), and the keys
can be specified in Base32 (RFC3548) or hexadecimal notation.
Proxmox VE provides a key generation tool ( oathkeygen ) which prints out a random
key in Base32 notation, that can be used directly with various OTP tools, such
as the oathtool command-line tool, or on Android Google Authenticator,
FreeOTP, andOTP or similar applications.
YubiKey OTP
For authenticating via a YubiKey a Yubico API ID, API KEY and validation
server URL must be configured, and users must have a YubiKey available. In
order to get the key ID from a YubiKey, you can trigger the YubiKey once
after connecting it via USB, and copy the first 12 characters of the typed
password into the user’s Key IDs field.
Please refer to the YubiKey OTP
documentation for how to use the
YubiCloud or
host your own verification server .
Limits and Lockout of Two-Factor Authentication
A second factor is meant to protect users if their password is somehow leaked
or guessed. However, some factors could still be broken by brute force. For
this reason, users will be locked out after too many failed 2nd factor login
attempts.
For TOTP, 8 failed attempts will disable the user’s TOTP factors. They are
unlocked when logging in with a recovery key. If TOTP was the only available
factor, admin intervention is required, and it is highly recommended to require
the user to change their password immediately.
Since FIDO2/Webauthn and recovery keys are less susceptible to brute force
attacks, the limit there is higher (100 tries), but all second factors are
blocked for an hour when exceeded.
An admin can unlock a user’s Two-Factor Authentication at any time via the user
list in the UI or the command line:
pveum user tfa unlock joe@pve
User Configured TOTP Authentication
Users can choose to enable TOTP or WebAuthn as a second factor on login, via
the TFA button in the user list (unless the realm enforces YubiKey OTP ).
Users can always add and use one time Recovery Keys .
After opening the TFA window, the user is presented with a dialog to set up
TOTP authentication. The Secret field contains the key, which can be
randomly generated via the Randomize button. An optional Issuer Name can be
added to provide information to the TOTP app about what the key belongs to.
Most TOTP apps will show the issuer name together with the corresponding
OTP values. The username is also included in the QR code for the TOTP app.
After generating a key, a QR code will be displayed, which can be used with most
OTP apps such as FreeOTP. The user then needs to verify the current user
password (unless logged in as root ), as well as the ability to correctly use
the TOTP key, by typing the current OTP value into the Verification Code
field and pressing the Apply button.
TOTP
There is no server setup required. Simply install a TOTP app on your
smartphone (for example, FreeOTP ) and use
the Proxmox VE web interface to add a TOTP factor.
WebAuthn
For WebAuthn to work, you need to have two things:
A trusted HTTPS certificate (for example, by using
Let’s Encrypt ).
While it probably works with an untrusted certificate, some browsers may
warn or refuse WebAuthn operations if it is not trusted.
Setup the WebAuthn configuration (see Datacenter → Options →
WebAuthn Settings in the Proxmox VE web interface). This can be
auto-filled in most setups.
Once you have fulfilled both of these requirements, you can add a WebAuthn
configuration in the Two Factor panel under Datacenter → Permissions → Two
Factor .
Recovery Keys
Recovery key codes do not need any preparation; you can simply create a
set of recovery keys in the Two Factor panel under Datacenter → Permissions
→ Two Factor .
There can only be one set of single-use recovery keys per user at any
time.
Server Side Webauthn Configuration
To allow users to use WebAuthn authentication, it is necessary to use a valid
domain with a valid SSL certificate, otherwise some browsers may warn or refuse
to authenticate altogether.
Changing the WebAuthn configuration may render all existing WebAuthn
registrations unusable!
This is done via /etc/pve/datacenter.cfg . For instance:
webauthn: rp=mypve.example.com,origin=https://mypve.example.com:8006,id=mypve.example.com
Server Side U2F Configuration
It is recommended to use WebAuthn instead.
To allow users to use U2F authentication, it may be necessary to use a valid
domain with a valid SSL certificate, otherwise, some browsers may print
a warning or reject U2F usage altogether. Initially, an AppId
[AppId https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/App_ID.html ]
needs to be configured.
Changing the AppId will render all existing U2F registrations
unusable!
u2f: appid=https://mypve.example.com:8006
For a single node, the AppId can simply be the address of the web interface,
exactly as it is used in the browser, including the https:// and the port, as
shown above. Please note that some browsers may be more strict than others when
matching AppIds .
When using multiple nodes, it is best to have a separate https server
providing an appid.json
[Multi-facet apps: https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/App_ID.html ]
file, as it seems to be compatible with most
browsers. If all nodes use subdomains of the same top level domain, it may be
enough to use the TLD as AppId . It should however be noted that some browsers
may not accept this.
A bad AppId will usually produce an error, but we have encountered
situations when this does not happen, particularly when using a top level domain
AppId for a node that is accessed via a subdomain in Chromium. For this reason
it is recommended to test the configuration with multiple browsers, as changing
the AppId later will render existing U2F registrations unusable.
Activating U2F as a User
To enable U2F authentication, open the TFA window’s U2F tab, type in the
current password (unless logged in as root), and press the Register button.
If the server is set up correctly and the browser accepts the server’s provided
AppId , a message will appear prompting the user to press the button on the
U2F device (if it is a YubiKey , the button light should be toggling on and
off steadily, roughly twice per second).
Firefox users may need to enable security.webauth.u2f via about:config
before they can use a U2F token.
Permission Management
In order for a user to perform an action (such as listing, modifying or
deleting parts of a VM’s configuration), the user needs to have the
appropriate permissions.
Proxmox VE uses a role and path based permission management system. An entry in
the permissions table allows a user, group or token to take on a specific role
when accessing an object or path . This means that such an access rule can
be represented as a triple of (path, user, role) , (path, group,
role) or (path, token, role) , with the role containing a set of allowed
actions, and the path representing the target of these actions.
Roles
A role is simply a list of privileges. Proxmox VE comes with a number
of predefined roles, which satisfy most requirements.
Administrator : has full privileges
NoAccess : has no privileges (used to forbid access)
PVEAdmin : can do most tasks, but has no rights to modify system settings
( Sys.PowerMgmt , Sys.Modify , Realm.Allocate ) or permissions
( Permissions.Modify )
PVEAuditor : has read only access
PVEDatastoreAdmin : create and allocate backup space and templates
PVEDatastoreUser : allocate backup space and view storage
PVEMappingAdmin : manage resource mappings
PVEMappingUser : view and use resource mappings
PVEPoolAdmin : allocate pools
PVEPoolUser : view pools
PVESDNAdmin : manage SDN configuration
PVESDNUser : access to bridges/vnets
PVESysAdmin : audit, system console and system logs
PVETemplateUser : view and clone templates
PVEUserAdmin : manage users
PVEVMAdmin : fully administer VMs
PVEVMUser : view, backup, configure CD-ROM, VM console, VM power management
You can see the whole set of predefined roles in the GUI.
You can add new roles via the GUI or the command line.
From the GUI, navigate to the Permissions → Roles tab from Datacenter and
click on the Create button. There you can set a role name and select any
desired privileges from the Privileges drop-down menu.
To add a role through the command line, you can use the pveum CLI tool, for
example:
pveum role add VM_Power-only --privs "VM.PowerMgmt VM.Console"
pveum role add Sys_Power-only --privs "Sys.PowerMgmt Sys.Console"
Roles starting with PVE are always builtin, custom roles are not
allowed use this reserved prefix.
Privileges
A privilege is the right to perform a specific action. To simplify
management, lists of privileges are grouped into roles, which can then
be used in the permission table. Note that privileges cannot be directly
assigned to users and paths without being part of a role.
We currently support the following privileges:
Node / System related privileges
Group.Allocate : create/modify/remove groups
Mapping.Audit : view resource mappings
Mapping.Modify : manage resource mappings
Mapping.Use : use resource mappings
Permissions.Modify : modify access permissions

Realm.AllocateUser : assign user to a realm
Realm.Allocate : create/modify/remove authentication realms
SDN.Allocate : manage SDN configuration
SDN.Audit : view SDN configuration
Sys.Audit : view node status/config, Corosync cluster config, and HA config
Sys.Console : console access to node
Sys.Incoming : allow incoming data streams from other clusters (experimental)
Sys.Modify : create/modify/remove node network parameters
Sys.PowerMgmt : node power management (start, stop, reset, shutdown, …)
Sys.Syslog : view syslog
User.Modify : create/modify/remove user access and details.
Virtual machine related privileges

Both Permissions.Modify and Sys.Modify should be handled with
care, as they allow modifying aspects of the system and its configuration that
are dangerous or sensitive.
Carefully read the section about inheritance below to understand how
assigned roles (and their privileges) are propagated along the ACL tree.
Objects and Paths
Access permissions are assigned to objects, such as virtual machines,
storages or resource pools.
We use file system like paths to address these objects. These paths form a
natural tree, and permissions of higher levels (shorter paths) can
optionally be propagated down within this hierarchy.
Paths can be templated. When an API call requires permissions on a
templated path, the path may contain references to parameters of the API
call. These references are specified in curly braces. Some parameters are
implicitly taken from the API call’s URI. For instance, the permission path
/nodes/{node} when calling /nodes/mynode/status requires permissions on
/nodes/mynode , while the path {path} in a PUT request to /access/acl
refers to the method’s path parameter.
Some examples are:
/nodes/{node} : Access to Proxmox VE server machines
/vms : Covers all VMs
/vms/{vmid} : Access to specific VMs
/storage/{storeid} : Access to a specific storage
/pool/{poolname} : Access to resources contained in a specific pool
/access/groups : Group administration
/access/realms/{realmid} : Administrative access to realms
Inheritance
As mentioned earlier, object paths form a file system like tree, and
permissions can be inherited by objects down that tree (the propagate flag is
set by default). We use the following inheritance rules:
Permissions for individual users always replace group permissions.
Permissions for groups apply when the user is member of that group.
Permissions on deeper levels replace those inherited from an upper level.
NoAccess cancels all other roles on a given path.
Additionally, privilege separated tokens can never have permissions on any
given path that their associated user does not have.
Pools
Pools can be used to group a set of virtual machines and datastores. You can
then simply set permissions on pools ( /pool/{poolid} ), which are inherited by
all pool members. This is a great way to simplify access control.
Which Permissions Do I Need?
The required API permissions are documented for each individual
method, and can be found at https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/api-viewer/ .
The permissions are specified as a list, which can be interpreted as a
tree of logic and access-check functions:
["and", <subtests>...] and ["or", <subtests>...]
Each( and ) or any( or ) further element in the current list has to be true.
["perm", <path>, [ <privileges>... ], <options>...]
The path is a templated parameter (see
Objects and Paths ). All (or, if the any
option is used, any) of the listed
privileges must be allowed on the specified path. If a require-param
option is specified, then its specified parameter is required even if the
API call’s schema otherwise lists it as being optional.
["userid-group", [ <privileges>... ], <options>...]
The caller must have any of the listed privileges on /access/groups . In
addition, there are two possible checks, depending on whether the
groups_param option is set:
groups_param is set: The API call has a non-optional groups parameter
and the caller must have any of the listed privileges on all of the listed
groups_param is not set: The user passed via the userid parameter
must exist and be part of a group on which the caller has any of the listed
privileges (via the /access/groups/<group> path).
["userid-param", "self"]
The value provided for the API call’s userid parameter must refer to the
user performing the action (usually in conjunction with or , to allow
users to perform an action on themselves, even if they don’t have elevated
privileges).
["userid-param", "Realm.AllocateUser"]
The user needs Realm.AllocateUser access to /access/realm/<realm> , with
<realm> referring to the realm of the user passed via the userid
parameter. Note that the user does not need to exist in order to be
associated with a realm, since user IDs are passed in the form of
<username>@<realm> .
["perm-modify", <path>]
Objects and Paths ). The user needs either the
Permissions.Modify privilege or,
depending on the path, the following privileges as a possible substitute:
/storage/... : requires 'Datastore.Allocate`
/vms/... : requires 'VM.Allocate`
/pool/... : requires 'Pool.Allocate`
If the path is empty, Permissions.Modify on /access is required.
If the user does not have the Permissions.Modify privilege, they can only
delegate subsets of their own privileges on the given path (e.g., a user with
PVEVMAdmin could assign PVEVMUser , but not PVEAdmin ).
Command-line Tool
Most users will simply use the GUI to manage users. But there is also
a fully featured command-line tool called pveum (short for “ P roxmox
VE U ser M anager”). Please note that all Proxmox VE command-line
tools are wrappers around the API, so you can also access those
functions through the REST API.
Here are some simple usage examples. To show help, type:
pveum
or (to show detailed help about a specific command)
pveum help user add
Create a new user:
pveum user add testuser@pve -comment "Just a test"
Set or change the password (not all realms support this):
pveum passwd testuser@pve
Disable a user:
pveum user modify testuser@pve -enable 0
Create a new group:
pveum group add testgroup
Create a new role:
pveum role add PVE_Power-only -privs "VM.PowerMgmt VM.Console"
Real World Examples
Administrator Group
It is possible that an administrator would want to create a group of users with
full administrator rights (without using the root account).
To do this, first define the group:
pveum group add admin -comment "System Administrators"
Then assign the role:
pveum acl modify / -group admin -role Administrator
Finally, you can add users to the new admin group:
pveum user modify testuser@pve -group admin
Auditors
You can give read only access to users by assigning the PVEAuditor
role to users or groups.
Example 1: Allow user joe@pve to see everything
pveum acl modify / -user joe@pve -role PVEAuditor
Example 2: Allow user joe@pve to see all virtual machines
pveum acl modify /vms -user joe@pve -role PVEAuditor
Delegate User Management
If you want to delegate user management to user joe@pve , you can do
that with:
pveum acl modify /access -user joe@pve -role PVEUserAdmin
User joe@pve can now add and remove users, and change other user attributes,
such as passwords. This is a very powerful role, and you most
likely want to limit it to selected realms and groups. The following
example allows joe@pve to modify users within the realm pve , if they
are members of group customers :
pveum acl modify /access/realm/pve -user joe@pve -role PVEUserAdmin
pveum acl modify /access/groups/customers -user joe@pve -role PVEUserAdmin
The user is able to add other users, but only if they are
members of the group customers and within the realm pve .
Limited API Token for Monitoring
Permissions on API tokens are always a subset of those of their corresponding
user, meaning that an API token can’t be used to carry out a task that the
backing user has no permission to do. This section will demonstrate how you can
use an API token with separate privileges, to limit the token owner’s
permissions further.
Give the user joe@pve the role PVEVMAdmin on all VMs:
pveum acl modify /vms -user joe@pve -role PVEVMAdmin
Add a new API token with separate privileges, which is only allowed to view VM
information (for example, for monitoring purposes):
pveum user token add joe@pve monitoring -privsep 1
pveum acl modify /vms -token 'joe@pve!monitoring' -role PVEAuditor
Verify the permissions of the user and token:
pveum user permissions joe@pve
pveum user token permissions joe@pve monitoring
An enterprise is usually structured into several smaller departments, and it is
common that you want to assign resources and delegate management tasks to each
of these. Let’s assume that you want to set up a pool for a software development
department. First, create a group:
pveum group add developers -comment "Our software developers"
Now we create a new user which is a member of that group:
pveum user add developer1@pve -group developers -password
The "-password" parameter will prompt you for a password
Then we create a resource pool for our development department to use:
pveum pool add dev-pool --comment "IT development pool"
Finally, we can assign permissions to that pool:
pveum acl modify /pool/dev-pool / -group developers -role PVEAdmin
Our software developers can now administer the resources assigned to
that pool.
