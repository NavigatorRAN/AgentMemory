An alternative server implementation of the Bitwarden Client API, written in Rust and compatible with official Bitwarden clients [ disclaimer ], perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be ideal.
Important
When using this server, please report any bugs or suggestions directly to us (see Get in touch ), regardless of whatever clients you are using (mobile, desktop, browser...). DO NOT use the official Bitwarden support channels.
Features
A nearly complete implementation of the Bitwarden Client API is provided, including:
Personal Vault
Send
Attachments
Website icons
Personal API Key
Organizations
Collections ,
Password Sharing ,
Member Roles ,
Groups ,
Event Logs ,
Admin Password Reset ,
Directory Connector ,
Policies
Multi/Two Factor Authentication
Authenticator ,
Email ,
FIDO2 WebAuthn ,
YubiKey ,
Duo
Emergency Access
Vaultwarden Admin Backend
Modified Web Vault client (Bundled within our containers)
Usage
The web-vault requires the use of HTTPS and a secure context for the Web Crypto API .
That means it will only work if you enable HTTPS .
We also suggest to use a reverse proxy .
The recommended way to install and use Vaultwarden is via our container images which are published to ghcr.io , docker.io and quay.io .
See which container image to use for an explanation of the provided tags.
There are also community driven packages which can be used, but those might be lagging behind the latest version or might deviate in the way Vaultwarden is configured, as described in our Wiki .
Alternatively, you can also build Vaultwarden yourself.
While Vaultwarden is based upon the Rocket web framework which has built-in support for TLS our recommendation would be that you setup a reverse proxy (see proxy examples ).
Tip
For more detailed examples on how to install, use and configure Vaultwarden you can check our Wiki .
Docker/Podman CLI
Pull the container image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage.
You can replace docker with podman if you prefer to use podman.
docker pull vaultwarden/server:latest
docker run --detach --name vaultwarden \
--env DOMAIN= " https://vw.domain.tld " \
--volume /vw-data/:/data/ \
--restart unless-stopped \
--publish 127.0.0.1:8000:80 \
vaultwarden/server:latest
This will preserve any persistent data under /vw-data/ , you can adapt the path to whatever suits you.
Docker Compose
To use Docker compose you need to create a compose.yaml which will hold the configuration to run the Vaultwarden container.
services :
vaultwarden :
image : vaultwarden/server:latest container_name : vaultwarden restart : unless-stopped environment :
DOMAIN : " https://vw.domain.tld " volumes :
- ./vw-data/:/data/ ports :
- 127.0.0.1:8000:80

Bitwarden_RS
This project was known as Bitwarden_RS and has been renamed to separate itself from the official Bitwarden server in the hopes of avoiding confusion and trademark/branding issues.
Please see #1642 - v1.21.0 release and project rename to Vaultwarden for more explanation.
You can’t perform that action at this time.
