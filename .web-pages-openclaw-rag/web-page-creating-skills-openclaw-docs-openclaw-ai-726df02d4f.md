Capabilities Skills
Skills teach the agent how and when to use tools. Each skill is a directory
containing a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions.
OpenClaw loads skills from several roots in a defined precedence order .
Create your first skill
Create the skill directory
Skills live in your workspace skills/ folder. Create a directory for your
new skill:
bash Copy code mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/hello-world
You can group skills in subfolders for organization — the skill is still
named by the SKILL.md frontmatter, not the folder path:
bash Copy code mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/personal/hello-world # skill name is still "hello-world", invoked as /hello-world
Write SKILL.md
Create SKILL.md inside the directory. The frontmatter defines metadata;
the body gives the agent instructions.
markdown Copy code --- name: hello-world description: A simple skill that prints a greeting. --- # Hello World When the user asks for a greeting, use the `exec` tool to run: ```bash echo "Hello from your custom skill!" Code Copy code Naming rules: - Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens for `name`. - Keep the directory name and frontmatter `name` aligned. - `description` is shown to the agent and in slash-command discovery — keep it one line and under 160 characters. OPENCLAW_DOCS_MARKER:stepClose: OPENCLAW_DOCS_MARKER:stepOpen:IHRpdGxlPSJWZXJpZnkgdGhlIHNraWxsIGxvYWRlZCI ```bash openclaw skills list
OpenClaw watches SKILL.md files under skills roots by default. If the
watcher is disabled or you are continuing an existing session, start a new
one so the agent receives the refreshed list:
bash Copy code # From chat — archive current session and start fresh /new # Or restart the gateway openclaw gateway restart
Test it
Send a message that should trigger the skill:
bash Copy code openclaw agent --message "give me a greeting"
Or open a chat and ask the agent directly. Use /skill hello-world to
invoke it explicitly by name.
SKILL.md reference
Required fields
Field Description name Unique slug using lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens description One-line description shown to the agent and in discovery output
Optional frontmatter keys
Field Default Description user-invocable true Expose the skill as a user slash command disable-model-invocation false Keep the skill out of the agent's system prompt (still runs via /skill ) command-dispatch — Set to tool to route the slash command directly to a tool, bypassing the model command-tool — Tool name to invoke when command-dispatch: tool is set command-arg-mode raw For tool dispatch, forwards the raw args string to the tool homepage — URL shown as "Website" in the macOS Skills UI
For gating fields ( requires.bins , requires.env , etc.) see
Skills — Gating .
Using {baseDir}
Use {baseDir} in the skill body to reference files inside the skill
directory without hardcoding paths:
markdown Copy code Run the helper script at `{baseDir}/scripts/run.sh` .
Adding conditional activation
Gate your skill so it only loads when its dependencies are available:
markdown Copy code --- name: gemini-search description: Search using Gemini CLI. metadata: { "openclaw": { "requires": { "bins": ["gemini"] }, "primaryEnv": "GEMINI _API_ KEY" } } ---
Gating options
Key Description requires.bins All binaries must exist on PATH requires.anyBins At least one binary must exist on PATH requires.env Each env var must exist in the process or config requires.config Each openclaw.json path must be truthy os Platform filter: ["darwin"] , ["linux"] , ["win32"] always Set true to skip all gates and always include the skill
Full reference: Skills — Gating .
Environment and API keys
Wire an API key to a skill entry in openclaw.json :
json5 Copy code { skills : { entries : { "gemini-search" : { enabled : true , apiKey : { source : "env" , provider : "default" , id : "GEMINI_API_KEY" }, }, }, }, }
The key is injected into the host process for that agent turn only.
It does not reach the sandbox — see
sandboxed env vars .
Propose via Skill Workshop
For agent-drafted skills or when you want operator review before a skill goes
live, use Skill Workshop proposals instead of writing
SKILL.md directly.
bash Copy code # Propose a brand-new skill openclaw skills workshop propose-create \ --name "hello-world" \ --description "A simple skill that prints a greeting." \ --proposal ./PROPOSAL.md # Propose an update to an existing skill openclaw skills workshop propose-update hello-world \ --proposal ./PROPOSAL.md \ --description "Updated greeting skill"
Use --proposal-dir when the proposal includes support files:
bash Copy code openclaw skills workshop propose-create \ --name "hello-world" \ --description "A simple skill that prints a greeting." \ --proposal-dir ./hello-world-proposal/
The directory must contain PROPOSAL.md . Support files can go in assets/ ,
examples/ , references/ , scripts/ , or templates/ .
After review:
bash Copy code openclaw skills workshop inspect <proposal-id> openclaw skills workshop apply <proposal-id>
See Skill Workshop for the full proposal lifecycle.
Publishing to ClawHub
Ensure your SKILL.md is complete
Make sure name , description , and any metadata.openclaw gating fields
are set. Add a homepage URL if you have a project page.
Install the ClawHub skill
The ClawHub skill documents the current publish command shape and required
metadata:
bash Copy code openclaw skills install @openclaw/clawhub-publish
Publish
bash Copy code clawhub publish
See ClawHub — Publishing for the full flow.
Best practices
Tip
Be concise — instruct the model on what to do, not how to be an AI.
Safety first — if your skill uses exec , ensure prompts do not allow
arbitrary command injection from untrusted input.
Test locally — use openclaw agent --message "..." before sharing.
Use ClawHub — browse community skills at clawhub.ai
before building from scratch.
