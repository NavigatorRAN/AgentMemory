## Description

Generate music via music_generate across ComfyUI, fal, Google Lyria, MiniMax, and OpenRouter workflows

## Extracted Text

Capabilities Tools
The music_generate tool lets the agent create music or audio through the
shared music-generation capability with configured providers — ComfyUI,
fal, Google, MiniMax, and OpenRouter today.
For session-backed agent runs, OpenClaw starts music generation as a
background task, tracks it in the task ledger, then wakes the agent again
when the track is ready so the agent can tell the user and attach the
finished audio. The completion agent follows the session's normal visible-reply
mode: automatic final reply delivery when configured, or message(action="send")
when the session requires the message tool. If the requester session is
inactive or its active wake fails, and some generated audio is still missing
from the completion reply, OpenClaw sends an idempotent direct fallback with
only the missing audio.
Note
The built-in shared tool only appears when at least one music-generation
provider is available. If you do not see music_generate in your agent's
tools, configure agents.defaults.musicGenerationModel or set up a
provider API key.
Quick start
Shared provider-backed
Configure auth
Set an API key for at least one provider — for example
GEMINI_API_KEY or MINIMAX_API_KEY .
Pick a default model (optional)
json5 Copy code { agents : { defaults : { musicGenerationModel : { primary : "google/lyria-3-clip-preview" , }, }, }, }
Ask the agent
"Generate an upbeat synthpop track about a night drive through a
neon city."
The agent calls music_generate automatically. No tool
allow-listing needed.
For direct synchronous contexts without a session-backed agent run,
the built-in tool still falls back to inline generation and returns
the final media path in the tool result.
ComfyUI workflow
Configure the workflow
Configure plugins.entries.comfy.config.music with a workflow
JSON and prompt/output nodes.
Cloud auth (optional)
For Comfy Cloud, set COMFY_API_KEY or COMFY_CLOUD_API_KEY .
Call the tool
text Copy code /tool music_generate prompt="Warm ambient synth loop with soft tape texture"
Example prompts:
text Copy code Generate a cinematic piano track with soft strings and no vocals. text Copy code Generate an energetic chiptune loop about launching a rocket at sunrise.

Capability matrix
The explicit mode contract used by music_generate , contract tests, and the
shared live sweep:
Provider generate edit Edit limit Shared live lanes ComfyUI ✓ ✓ 1 image Not in the shared sweep; covered by extensions/comfy/comfy.live.test.ts fal ✓ — None generate Google ✓ ✓ 10 images generate , edit MiniMax ✓ — None generate OpenRouter ✓ ✓ 1 image generate , edit
Use action: "list" to inspect available shared providers and models at
runtime:
text Copy code /tool music_generate action=list
Use action: "status" to inspect the active session-backed music task:
text Copy code /tool music_generate action=status
Direct generation example:
text Copy code /tool music_generate prompt="Dreamy lo-fi hip hop with vinyl texture and gentle rain" instrumental=true
Tool parameters
Music generation prompt. Required for action: "generate" .
"status" returns the current session task; "list" inspects providers.
Provider/model override (e.g. google/lyria-3-pro-preview ,
comfy/workflow ).
Optional lyrics when the provider supports explicit lyric input.
Request instrumental-only output when the provider supports it.
Single reference image path or URL.
Multiple reference images (up to 10 on supporting providers).
Target duration in seconds when the provider supports duration hints.
Output format hint when the provider supports it.
Not all providers support all parameters. OpenClaw still validates hard
limits such as input counts before submission. When a provider supports
duration but uses a shorter maximum than the requested value, OpenClaw
clamps to the closest supported duration. Truly unsupported optional hints
are ignored with a warning when the selected provider or model cannot honor
them. Tool results report applied settings; details.normalization
captures any requested-to-applied mapping.
Provider request timeouts are operator configuration only. OpenClaw uses
agents.defaults.musicGenerationModel.timeoutMs when configured, raises values
below 120000ms to 120000ms, and otherwise defaults provider requests to
300000ms.
Async behavior
Session-backed music generation runs as a background task:
Background task: music_generate creates a background task, returns a
started/task response immediately, and posts the finished track later in
a follow-up agent message.
Duplicate prevention: while a task is queued or running , later
music_generate calls in the same session return task status instead of
starting another generation. Use action: "status" to check explicitly.
Status lookup: openclaw tasks list or openclaw tasks show <taskId>
inspects queued, running, and terminal status.
Completion wake: OpenClaw injects an internal completion event back
into the same session so the model can write the user-facing follow-up
itself.
Prompt hint: later user/manual turns in the same session get a small
runtime hint when a music task is already in flight, so the model does
not blindly call music_generate again.
No-session fallback: direct/local contexts without a real agent
session run inline and return the final audio result in the same turn.
Task lifecycle
State Meaning queued Task created, waiting for the provider to accept it. running Provider is processing (typically 30 seconds to 3 minutes depending on provider and duration). succeeded Track ready; the agent wakes and posts it to the conversation. failed Provider error or timeout; the agent wakes with error details.
Check status from the CLI:
bash Copy code openclaw tasks list openclaw tasks show <taskId> openclaw tasks cancel <taskId>
Configuration
Model selection
json5 Copy code { agents : { defaults : { musicGenerationModel : { primary : "google/lyria-3-clip-preview" , fallbacks : [ "fal/fal-ai/minimax-music/v2.6" , "minimax/music-2.6" ], }, }, }, }
Provider selection order
OpenClaw tries providers in this order:
model parameter from the tool call (if the agent specifies one).
musicGenerationModel.primary from config.
musicGenerationModel.fallbacks in order.
Auto-detection using auth-backed provider defaults only:
current default provider first;
remaining registered music-generation providers in provider-id order.
If a provider fails, the next candidate is tried automatically. If all
fail, the error includes details from each attempt.
Set agents.defaults.mediaGenerationAutoProviderFallback: false to use only
explicit model , primary , and fallbacks entries.
Provider notes
ComfyUI
Workflow-driven and depends on the configured graph plus node mapping
for prompt/output fields. The bundled comfy plugin plugs into the
shared music_generate tool through the music-generation provider
registry.
fal
Uses fal model endpoints through the shared provider auth path. The
bundled provider defaults to fal-ai/minimax-music/v2.6 and also exposes
fal-ai/ace-step/prompt-to-audio and
fal-ai/stable-audio-25/text-to-audio for prompt-to-audio requests.
Google (Lyria 3)
Uses Lyria 3 batch generation. The current bundled flow supports
prompt, optional lyrics text, and optional reference images.
MiniMax
Uses the batch music_generation endpoint. Supports prompt, optional
lyrics, instrumental mode, and mp3 output through either minimax
API-key auth or minimax-portal OAuth.
OpenRouter
Uses OpenRouter chat completions audio output with streaming enabled. The
bundled provider defaults to google/lyria-3-pro-preview and also exposes
openrouter/google/lyria-3-clip-preview .
Choosing the right path
Shared provider-backed when you want model selection, provider
failover, and the built-in async task/status flow.
Plugin path (ComfyUI) when you need a custom workflow graph or a
provider that is not part of the shared bundled music capability.
If you are debugging ComfyUI-specific behavior, see
ComfyUI . If you are debugging shared provider
behavior, start with fal , Google (Gemini) ,
MiniMax , or OpenRouter .
Provider capability modes
The shared music-generation contract supports explicit mode declarations:
generate for prompt-only generation.
edit when the request includes one or more reference images.
New provider implementations should prefer explicit mode blocks:
typescript Copy code capabilities : { generate : { maxTracks : 1 , supportsLyrics : true , supportsFormat : true , }, edit : { enabled : true , maxTracks : 1 , maxInputImages : 1 , supportsFormat : true , }, }
Legacy flat fields such as maxInputImages , supportsLyrics , and
supportsFormat are not enough to advertise edit support. Providers
should declare generate and edit explicitly so live tests, contract
tests, and the shared music_generate tool can validate mode support
deterministically.
Live tests
Opt-in live coverage for the shared bundled providers:
bash Copy code OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 pnpm test :live -- extensions/music-generation-providers.live.test.ts
Repo wrapper:
bash Copy code pnpm test :live:media music
This live file uses already-exported provider env vars ahead of stored auth
profiles by default, and runs both generate and declared edit coverage when
the provider enables edit mode. Coverage today:
google : generate plus edit
fal : generate only
minimax : generate only
openrouter : generate plus edit
comfy : separate Comfy live coverage, not the shared provider sweep
Opt-in live coverage for the bundled ComfyUI music path:
bash Copy code OPENCLAW_LIVE_TEST=1 COMFY_LIVE_TEST=1 pnpm test :live -- extensions/comfy/comfy.live.test.ts
The Comfy live file also covers comfy image and video workflows when those
sections are configured.
