DESCRIPTION
The Proxmox VE node management tool ( pvenode ) allows you to control node specific
settings and resources.
Currently pvenode allows you to set a node’s description, run various
bulk operations on the node’s guests, view the node’s task history, and
manage the node’s SSL certificates, which are used for the API and the web GUI
through pveproxy .
FORMAT_OPTIONS
It is possible to specify the output format using the
--output-format parameter. The default format text uses ASCII-art
to draw nice borders around tables. It additionally transforms some
values into human-readable text, for example:
Unix epoch is displayed as ISO 8601 date string.
Durations are displayed as week/day/hour/minute/second count, i.e 1d 5h .
Byte sizes value include units ( B , KiB , MiB , GiB , TiB , PiB ).
Fractions are display as percentage, i.e. 1.0 is displayed as 100%.
You can also completely suppress output using option --quiet .
--human-readable <boolean> ( default = 1 )
Call output rendering functions to produce human readable text.
--noborder <boolean> ( default = 0 )
Do not draw borders (for text format).
--noheader <boolean> ( default = 0 )
Do not show column headers (for text format).
--output-format <json | json-pretty | text | yaml> ( default = text )
Output format.
--quiet <boolean>
Suppress printing results.
Examples
Install an externally provided certificate
pvenode cert set certificate.crt certificate.key -force
Both files need to be PEM encoded. certificate.key contains the private key
and certificate.crt contains the whole certificate chain.
Setup ACME account and order a certificate for the local node.
pvenode acme account register default mail@example.invalid
pvenode config set --acme domains=example.invalid
pvenode acme cert order
systemctl restart pveproxy
Wake-on-LAN
Wake-on-LAN (WoL) allows you to switch on a sleeping computer in the network, by
sending a magic packet. At least one NIC must support this feature, and the
respective option needs to be enabled in the computer’s firmware (BIOS/UEFI)
configuration. The option name can vary from Enable Wake-on-Lan to
Power On By PCIE Device ; check your motherboard’s vendor manual, if you’re
unsure. ethtool can be used to check the WoL configuration of <interface>
by running:
ethtool <interface> | grep Wake-on
pvenode allows you to wake sleeping members of a cluster via WoL, using the
command:
This broadcasts the WoL magic packet on UDP port 9, containing the MAC address
of <node> obtained from the wakeonlan property. The node-specific
wakeonlan property can be set using the following command:
pvenode config set -wakeonlan XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
The interface via which to send the WoL packet is determined from the default
route. It can be overwritten by setting the bind-interface via the following
pvenode config set -wakeonlan XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,bind-interface=<iface-name>
The broadcast address (default 255.255.255.255 ) used when sending the WoL
packet can further be changed by setting the broadcast-address explicitly
using the following command:
pvenode config set -wakeonlan XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,broadcast-address=<broadcast-address>
Task History
When troubleshooting server issues, for example, failed backup jobs, it can
often be helpful to have a log of the previously run tasks. With Proxmox VE, you can
access the nodes’s task history through the pvenode task command.
You can get a filtered list of a node’s finished tasks with the list
subcommand. For example, to get a list of tasks related to VM 100
that ended with an error, the command would be:
pvenode task list --errors --vmid 100
The log of a task can then be printed using its UPID:
pvenode task log UPID:pve1:00010D94:001CA6EA:6124E1B9:vzdump:100:root@pam:
Bulk Guest Power Management
In case you have many VMs/containers, starting and stopping guests can be
carried out in bulk operations with the startall and stopall subcommands of
pvenode . By default, pvenode startall will only start VMs/containers which
have been set to automatically start on boot (see
Automatic Start and Shutdown of Virtual Machines ),
however, you can override this behavior with the --force flag. Both commands
also have a --vms option, which limits the stopped/started guests to the
specified VMIDs.
For example, to start VMs 100 , 101 , and 102 , regardless of whether they
have onboot set, you can use:
pvenode startall --vms 100,101,102 --force
To stop these guests (and any other guests that may be running), use the
pvenode stopall
The stopall command first attempts to perform a clean shutdown and then
waits until either all guests have successfully shut down or an overridable
timeout (3 minutes by default) has expired. Once that happens and the
force-stop parameter is not explicitly set to 0 (false), all virtual guests
that are still running are hard stopped.
First Guest Boot Delay
In case your VMs/containers rely on slow-to-start external resources, for
example an NFS server, you can also set a per-node delay between the time Proxmox VE
boots and the time the first VM/container that is configured to autostart boots
(see Automatic Start and Shutdown of Virtual Machines ).
You can achieve this by setting the following (where 10 represents the delay
in seconds):
pvenode config set --startall-onboot-delay 10
Bulk Guest Migration
In case an upgrade situation requires you to migrate all of your guests from one
node to another, pvenode also offers the migrateall subcommand for bulk
migration. By default, this command will migrate every guest on the system to
the target node. It can however be set to only migrate a set of guests.
For example, to migrate VMs 100 , 101 , and 102 , to the node pve2 , with
live-migration for local disks enabled, you can run:
pvenode migrateall pve2 --vms 100,101,102 --with-local-disks
RAM Usage Target for Ballooning
The target percentage for automatic memory allocation
defaults to 80%. You can customize this target per node by setting the
ballooning-target property. For example, to target 90% host memory usage
instead:
pvenode config set --ballooning-target 90
