Capabilities Skills
The Gateway handles commands sent as standalone messages starting with / .
Host-only bash commands use ! <cmd> (with /bash <cmd> as an alias).
When a conversation is bound to an ACP session, normal text routes to the ACP
harness. Gateway management commands remain local: /acp ... always reaches
the OpenClaw command handler, and /status plus /unfocus stay local whenever
command handling is enabled for the surface.
Three command types
Commands
Standalone /... messages handled by the Gateway. Must be sent as the
only content in the message.
Directives
/think , /fast , /verbose , /trace , /reasoning , /elevated ,
/exec , /model , /queue — stripped from the message before the model
sees it. Persist session settings when sent alone; act as inline hints
when sent with other text.
Inline shortcuts
/help , /commands , /status , /whoami — run immediately and are
stripped before the model sees the remaining text. Authorized senders only.
Directive behavior details
Directives are stripped from the message before the model sees it.
In directive-only messages (the message is only directives), they
persist to the session and reply with an acknowledgement.
In normal chat messages with other text, they act as inline hints and
do not persist session settings.
Directives only apply for authorized senders . If commands.allowFrom
is set, it is the only allowlist used; otherwise authorization comes from
channel allowlists/pairing plus commands.useAccessGroups . Unauthorized
senders see directives treated as plain text.
Configuration
json5 Copy code { commands : { native : "auto" , nativeSkills : "auto" , text : true , bash : false , bashForegroundMs : 2000 , config : false , mcp : false , plugins : false , debug : false , restart : true , ownerAllowFrom : [ "discord:123456789012345678" ], ownerDisplay : "raw" , ownerDisplaySecret : "${OWNER_ID_HASH_SECRET}" , allowFrom : { "*" : [ "user1" ], discord : [ "user:123" ], }, useAccessGroups : true , }, }
Enables parsing /... in chat messages. On surfaces without native commands
(WhatsApp, WebChat, Signal, iMessage, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams), text
commands work even when set to false .
Registers native commands. Auto: on for Discord/Telegram; off for Slack;
ignored for providers without native support. Override per-channel with
channels.<provider>.commands.native . On Discord, false skips slash-command
registration; previously registered commands may stay visible until removed.
Registers skill commands natively when supported. Auto: on for
Discord/Telegram; off for Slack. Override with
channels.<provider>.commands.nativeSkills .
Enables ! <cmd> to run host shell commands ( /bash <cmd> alias). Requires
tools.elevated allowlists.
How long bash waits before switching to background mode ( 0 backgrounds
immediately).
Enables /config (reads/writes openclaw.json ). Owner-only.
Enables /mcp (reads/writes OpenClaw-managed MCP config under mcp.servers ). Owner-only.
Enables /plugins (plugin discovery/status plus install + enable/disable). Owner-only for writes.
Enables /debug (runtime-only config overrides). Owner-only.
Enables /restart and gateway restart tool actions.
Explicit owner allowlist for owner-only command surfaces. Separate from
commands.allowFrom and DM pairing access.
OPENCLAW_DOCS_MARKER:paramOpen:IHBhdGg9ImNoYW5uZWxzLjxjaGFubmVs
.commands.enforceOwnerForCommands" type="boolean" default="false">
Per-channel: requires owner identity for owner-only commands. When true ,
sender must match commands.ownerAllowFrom or hold internal operator.admin
scope. A wildcard allowFrom entry is not sufficient.
Controls how owner ids appear in the system prompt.
HMAC secret used when commands.ownerDisplay: "hash" .
Per-provider allowlist for command authorization. When configured, it is the
only authorization source for commands and directives. Use "*" for a
global default; provider-specific keys override it.
Enforces allowlists/policies for commands when commands.allowFrom is not set.
Command list
Commands come from three sources:
Core built-ins: src/auto-reply/commands-registry.shared.ts
Generated dock commands: src/auto-reply/commands-registry.data.ts
Plugin commands: plugin registerCommand() calls
Availability depends on config flags, channel surface, and installed/enabled
plugins.
Core commands
Sessions and runs
Command Description /new [model] Archive the current session and start a fresh one /reset [soft [message]] Reset the current session in place. soft keeps the transcript, drops reused CLI backend session ids, and reruns startup /name <title> Name or rename the current session. Omit the title to see the current name and a suggestion /compact [instructions] Compact the session context. See Compaction /stop Abort the current run /session idle <duration|off> Manage thread-binding idle expiry /session max-age <duration|off> Manage thread-binding max-age expiry /export-session [path] Export the current session to HTML. Alias: /export /export-trajectory [path] Export a JSONL trajectory bundle for the current session. Alias: /trajectory
Note
Control UI intercepts typed /new to create and switch to a fresh
dashboard session, except when session.dmScope: "main" is configured
and the current parent is the agent's main session — in that case /new
resets the main session in place. Typed /reset still runs the Gateway's
in-place reset. Use /model default when you want to clear a pinned
session model selection.
Model and run controls
Command Description /think <level|default> Set the thinking level or clear the session override. Aliases: /thinking , /t /verbose on|off|full Toggle verbose output. Alias: /v /trace on|off Toggle plugin trace output for the current session /fast [status|auto|on|off|default] Show, set, or clear fast mode /reasoning [on|off|stream] Toggle reasoning visibility. Alias: /reason /elevated [on|off|ask|full] Toggle elevated mode. Alias: /elev /exec host=<auto|sandbox|gateway|node> security=<deny|allowlist|full> ask=<off|on-miss|always> node=<id> Show or set exec defaults /model [name|#|status] Show or set the model /models [provider] [page] [limit=<n>|all] List configured/auth-available providers or models /queue <mode> Manage active-run queue behavior. See Queue and Queue steering /steer <message> Inject guidance into the active run. Alias: /tell . See Steer
verbose / trace / fast / reasoning safety
/verbose is for debugging — keep it off in normal use.
/trace reveals only plugin-owned trace/debug lines; normal verbose chatter stays off.
/fast auto|on|off persists a session override; use the Sessions UI inherit option to clear it.
/fast is provider-specific: OpenAI/Codex map it to service_tier=priority ; direct Anthropic requests map it to service_tier=auto or standard_only .
/reasoning , /verbose , and /trace are risky in group settings — they may reveal internal reasoning or plugin diagnostics. Keep them off in group chats.
Model switching details
/model persists the new model immediately to the session.
If the agent is idle, the next run uses it right away.
If a run is active, the switch is marked pending and applied at the next clean retry point.
Discovery and status
Command Description /help Show the short help summary /commands Show the generated command catalog /tools [compact|verbose] Show what the current agent can use right now /status Show execution/runtime status, Gateway and system uptime, plugin health, plus provider usage/quota /status plugins Show detailed plugin health: load errors, quarantines, channel failures, dependency issues, compatibility notices /goal [status|start|pause|resume|complete|block|clear] ... Manage the current session's durable goal /diagnostics [note] Owner-only support-report flow. Asks for exec approval every time /crestodian <request> Run the Crestodian setup and repair helper from an owner DM /tasks List active/recent background tasks for the current session /context [list|detail|map|json] Explain how context is assembled /whoami Show your sender id. Alias: /id /usage off|tokens|full|cost Control the per-response usage footer or print a local cost summary
Skills, allowlists, approvals
Command Description /skill <name> [input] Run a skill by name /allowlist [list|add|remove] ... Manage allowlist entries. Text-only /approve <id> <decision> Resolve exec or plugin approval prompts /btw <question> Ask a side question without changing session context. Alias: /side . See BTW
Subagents and ACP

Owner-only /mcp show|get|set|unset commands.mcp: true Read or write OpenClaw-managed MCP server config. Owner-only /plugins list|inspect|show|get|install|enable|disable commands.plugins: true Inspect or mutate plugin state. Owner-only for writes. Alias: /plugin /debug show|set|unset|reset commands.debug: true Runtime-only config overrides. Owner-only /restart commands.restart: true (default) Restart OpenClaw /send on|off|inherit owner Set send policy
Voice, TTS, channel control
Command Description /tts on|off|status|chat|latest|provider|limit|summary|audio|help Control TTS. See TTS /activation mention|always Set group activation mode /bash <command> Run a host shell command. Alias: ! <command> . Requires commands.bash: true !poll [sessionId] Check a background bash job !stop [sessionId] Stop a background bash job
Dock commands
Dock commands switch the active session's reply route to another linked channel.
See Channel docking for setup and troubleshooting.
Generated from channel plugins with native-command support:
/dock-discord (alias: /dock_discord )
/dock-mattermost (alias: /dock_mattermost )
/dock-slack (alias: /dock_slack )
/dock-telegram (alias: /dock_telegram )
Dock commands require session.identityLinks . The source sender and target peer
must be in the same identity group.
Bundled plugin commands
Command Description /dreaming [on|off|status|help] Toggle memory dreaming. See Dreaming /pair [qr|status|pending|approve|cleanup|notify] Manage device pairing. See Pairing /phone status|arm ...|disarm Temporarily arm high-risk phone node commands /voice status|list|set <voiceId> Manage Talk voice config. Discord native name: /talkvoice /card ... Send LINE rich card presets. See LINE /codex status|models|threads|resume|compact|review|diagnostics|account|mcp|skills Control the Codex app-server harness. See Codex harness
QQBot-only: /bot-ping , /bot-version , /bot-help , /bot-upgrade , /bot-logs
Skill commands
User-invocable skills are exposed as slash commands:
/skill <name> [input] always works as the generic entrypoint.
Skills may register as direct commands (e.g. /prose for OpenProse).
Native skill-command registration is controlled by commands.nativeSkills and
Names are sanitized to a-z0-9_ (max 32 chars); collisions get numeric suffixes.
Skill command dispatch
By default, skill commands route to the model as a normal request.
Skills can declare command-dispatch: tool to route directly to a tool
(deterministic, no model involvement). Example: /prose (OpenProse plugin)
— see OpenProse .
Native command arguments
Discord uses autocomplete for dynamic options and button menus when required
args are omitted. Telegram and Slack show a button menu for commands with
choices. Dynamic choices resolve against the target session model, so model-
specific options like /think levels follow the session's /model override.
/tools — what the agent can use now
/tools answers a runtime question: what this agent can use right now in this
conversation — not a static config catalog.
text Copy code /tools # compact view /tools verbose # with short descriptions
Results are session-scoped. Changing agent, channel, thread, sender
authorization, or model can change the output. For profile and override editing,
use the Control UI Tools panel or config surfaces.
/model — model selection
text Copy code /model # show model picker /model list # same /model 3 # select by number from picker /model openai/gpt-5.4 /model opus@anthropic:default /model default # clear the session model selection /model status # detailed view with endpoint and API mode
On Discord, /model and /models open an interactive picker with provider and
model dropdowns. The picker respects agents.defaults.models , including
provider/* entries.
/config — on-disk config writes
Owner-only. Disabled by default — enable with commands.config: true .
text Copy code /config show /config show messages.responsePrefix /config get messages.responsePrefix /config set messages.responsePrefix="[openclaw]" /config unset messages.responsePrefix
Config is validated before write. Invalid changes are rejected. /config
updates persist across restarts.
/mcp — MCP server config
Owner-only. Disabled by default — enable with commands.mcp: true .
text Copy code /mcp show /mcp show context7 /mcp set context7={"command":"uvx","args":["context7-mcp"]} /mcp unset context7
/mcp stores config in OpenClaw config, not embedded-agent project settings.
/debug — runtime-only overrides
Owner-only. Disabled by default — enable with commands.debug: true .
Overrides apply immediately to new config reads but do not write to disk.
text Copy code /debug show /debug set messages.responsePrefix="[openclaw]" /debug set channels.whatsapp.allowFrom=["+1555","+4477"] /debug unset messages.responsePrefix /debug reset
/plugins — plugin management
Owner-only for writes. Disabled by default — enable with commands.plugins: true .
text Copy code /plugins /plugins list /plugin show context7 /plugins enable context7 /plugins disable context7 /plugins install ./path/to/plugin
/plugins enable|disable updates plugin config and hot-reloads the Gateway
plugin runtime for new agent turns. /plugins install restarts managed
Gateways automatically because plugin source modules changed.
/trace — plugin trace output
text Copy code /trace # show current trace state /trace on /trace off
/trace reveals session-scoped plugin trace/debug lines without full verbose
mode. It does not replace /debug (runtime overrides) or /verbose (normal
tool output).
/btw — side questions
/btw is a quick side question about the current session context. Alias: /side .
text Copy code /btw what are we doing right now? /side what changed while the main run continued?
Unlike a normal message:
Uses the current session as background context.
In Codex harness sessions, runs as an ephemeral Codex side thread.
Does not change future session context.
Is not written to transcript history.
See BTW side questions for the full behavior.
Surface notes
Session scoping per surface
Text commands: run in the normal chat session (DMs share main , groups have their own session).
Native Discord commands: agent:<agentId>:discord:slash:<userId>
Native Slack commands: agent:<agentId>:slack:slash:<userId> (prefix configurable via channels.slack.slashCommand.sessionPrefix )
Native Telegram commands: telegram:slash:<userId> (targets the chat session via CommandTargetSessionKey )
/stop targets the active chat session to abort the current run.
Slack specifics
channels.slack.slashCommand supports a single /openclaw -style command.
With commands.native: true , create one Slack slash command per built-in
command. Register /agentstatus (not /status ) because Slack reserves
/status . Text /status still works in Slack messages.
Fast path and inline shortcuts
Command-only messages from allowlisted senders are handled immediately (bypass queue + model).
Inline shortcuts ( /help , /commands , /status , /whoami ) also work embedded in normal messages and are stripped before the model sees the remaining text.
Unauthorized command-only messages are silently ignored; inline /... tokens are treated as plain text.
Argument notes
Commands accept an optional : between the command and args ( /think: high , /send: on ).
/new <model> accepts a model alias, provider/model , or a provider name (fuzzy match); if no match, the text is treated as the message body.
/allowlist add|remove requires commands.config: true and honors channel configWrites .
Provider usage and status
Provider usage/quota (e.g., "Claude 80% left") shows in /status for the current model provider when usage tracking is enabled.
Token/cache lines in /status can fall back to the latest transcript usage entry when the live session snapshot is sparse.
Execution vs runtime: /status reports Execution for the effective sandbox path and Runtime for who is running the session: OpenClaw Default , OpenAI Codex , a CLI backend, or an ACP backend.
Per-response tokens/cost: controlled by /usage off|tokens|full .
/model status is about models/auth/endpoints, not usage.
