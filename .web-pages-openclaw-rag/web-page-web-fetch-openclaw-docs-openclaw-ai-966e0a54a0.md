## Description

web_fetch tool -- HTTP fetch with readable content extraction

## Extracted Text

Close
Capabilities Tools
The web_fetch tool does a plain HTTP GET and extracts readable content
(HTML to markdown or text). It does not execute JavaScript.
For JS-heavy sites or login-protected pages, use the
Web Browser instead.
Quick start
web_fetch is enabled by default -- no configuration needed. The agent can
call it immediately:
javascript Copy code await web_fetch ({ url : "https://example.com/article" });
Tool parameters
URL to fetch. http(s) only.
Output format after main-content extraction.
Truncate output to this many characters.
How it works
Fetch
Sends an HTTP GET with a Chrome-like User-Agent and Accept-Language
header. Blocks private/internal hostnames and re-checks redirects.
Extract
Runs Readability (main-content extraction) on the HTML response.
Fallback (optional)
If Readability fails and Firecrawl is selected, retries through the
Firecrawl API with bot-circumvention mode.
Cache
Results are cached for 15 minutes (configurable) to reduce repeated
fetches of the same URL.
Progress updates
web_fetch emits a public progress line only when the fetch is still pending
after five seconds:
text Copy code Fetching page content...
Fast cache hits and quick network responses finish before the timer fires, so
they do not show a progress line. If the call is canceled, the timer is cleared.
When the fetch eventually completes, the agent receives the normal tool result;
the progress line is only channel UI state and never contains fetched page
content.
Config
json5 Copy code { tools : { web : { fetch : { enabled : true , // default: true provider : "firecrawl" , // optional; omit for auto-detect maxChars : 50000 , // max output chars maxCharsCap : 50000 , // hard cap for maxChars param maxResponseBytes : 2000000 , // max download size before truncation timeoutSeconds : 30 , cacheTtlMinutes : 15 , maxRedirects : 3 , useTrustedEnvProxy : false , // let a trusted HTTP(S) env proxy resolve DNS readability : true , // use Readability extraction userAgent : "Mozilla/5.0 ..." , // override User-Agent ssrfPolicy : { allowRfc2544BenchmarkRange : true , // opt-in for trusted fake-IP proxies using 198.18.0.0/15 allowIpv6UniqueLocalRange : true , // opt-in for trusted fake-IP proxies using fc00::/7 }, }, }, }, }
Firecrawl fallback
If Readability extraction fails, web_fetch can fall back to
Firecrawl for bot-circumvention and better extraction:
json5 Copy code { tools : { web : { fetch : { provider : "firecrawl" , // optional; omit for auto-detect from available credentials }, }, }, plugins : { entries : { firecrawl : { enabled : true , config : { webFetch : { // apiKey: "fc-...", // optional; omit for keyless starter access baseUrl : "https://api.firecrawl.dev" , onlyMainContent : true , maxAgeMs : 86400000 , // cache duration (1 day) timeoutSeconds : 60 , }, }, }, }, }, }
plugins.entries.firecrawl.config.webFetch.apiKey is optional and supports SecretRef objects.
Legacy tools.web.fetch.firecrawl.* config is auto-migrated by openclaw doctor --fix .
Note
If you configure a Firecrawl API-key SecretRef and it is unresolved with no
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY env fallback, gateway startup fails fast.
Firecrawl baseUrl overrides are locked down: hosted traffic uses
https://api.firecrawl.dev ; self-hosted overrides must target private or
internal endpoints, and http:// is accepted only for those private targets.
Current runtime behavior:
tools.web.fetch.provider selects the fetch fallback provider explicitly.
If provider is omitted, OpenClaw auto-detects the first ready web-fetch
provider from configured credentials. Non-sandboxed web_fetch can use
installed plugins that declare contracts.webFetchProviders and register a
matching provider at runtime. The official Firecrawl plugin provides this
fallback.
Sandboxed web_fetch calls allow bundled providers plus installed providers
whose official npm or ClawHub provenance is verified. Today that permits the
official Firecrawl plugin; third-party external fetch plugins stay excluded.
If Readability is disabled, web_fetch skips straight to the selected
provider fallback. If no provider is available, it fails closed.
Trusted env proxy
If your deployment requires web_fetch to go through a trusted outbound
HTTP(S) proxy, set tools.web.fetch.useTrustedEnvProxy: true .
In this mode, OpenClaw still applies hostname-based SSRF checks before sending
the request, but it lets the proxy resolve DNS instead of doing local DNS
pinning. Enable this only when the proxy is operator-controlled and enforces
outbound policy after DNS resolution.
If no HTTP(S) proxy env var is configured, or the target host is excluded by
NO_PROXY , web_fetch falls back to the normal strict path with local DNS
pinning.
Limits and safety
maxChars is clamped to tools.web.fetch.maxCharsCap
Response body is capped at maxResponseBytes before parsing; oversized
responses are truncated with a warning
Private/internal hostnames are blocked
tools.web.fetch.ssrfPolicy.allowRfc2544BenchmarkRange and
tools.web.fetch.ssrfPolicy.allowIpv6UniqueLocalRange are narrow opt-ins
for trusted fake-IP proxy stacks; leave them unset unless your proxy owns
those synthetic ranges and enforces its own destination policy
Redirects are checked and limited by maxRedirects
useTrustedEnvProxy is an explicit opt-in and should only be enabled for
operator-controlled proxies that still enforce outbound policy after DNS
resolution
web_fetch is best-effort -- some sites need the Web Browser
Tool profiles
If you use tool profiles or allowlists, add web_fetch or group:web :
json5 Copy code { tools : { allow : [ "web_fetch" ], // or: allow: ["group:web"] (includes web_fetch, web_search, and x_search) }, }
