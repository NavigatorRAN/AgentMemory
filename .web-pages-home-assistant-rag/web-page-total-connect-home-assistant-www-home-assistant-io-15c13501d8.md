The Total Connect integration Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] provides connectivity with Resideo Total Connect 2.0-enabled alarm systems.
The integration allows automations based on the state of the alarm system. For example: when the alarm is armed, turn on the outside light.
The integration can also arm or disarm the alarm panel. For example: when I arrive home, disarm the alarm panel
This integration supports alarm panels with “communicator modules” that are compatible with the Total Connect 2.0 service. An active account is required via a third party alarm monitoring company. Panels may be branded as Resideo, Honeywell, Ademco or other third party alarm companies.
Device models known to work include:
ProSeries (ProA7, ProA7Plus)
Lyric (AIO, Gateway)
Lynx Touch (L5100, L5200, L5210, L7000)
Lynx Plus (L3000)
VISTA (15P, 20P, 21iP)
The following devices are not supported:
Older Lynx models (not Touch or Plus)
Other panels without a Total Connect compatible communicator module
Log in to the Total Connect website and create a “standard” Total Connect user account specifically for use with Home Assistant. It should not have full administrative privileges.
Give the user access to your Location, along with a user code, usually a 4 digit number.
To add the Total Connect hub to your Home Assistant instance, use this My button:
Manual configuration steps
If the above My button doesn’t work, you can also perform the following steps
manually:
Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
Go to Settings > Devices & services .
In the bottom right corner, select the
Add Integration button.
From the list, select Total Connect .
Follow the instructions on screen to complete the setup.
Auto Bypass Low Battery: if enabled, TotalConnect zones will immediately be bypassed when they report low battery. This option helps because zones tend to report low battery in the middle of the night. The downside of this option is that when the alarm system is armed, the bypassed zone will not be monitored.
Require Code: if enabled, you must enter the user code to arm or disarm the alarm.
The integration provides an alarm control panel for each Total Connect location. It uses the name of your location from Total Connect. For example, if your location name in Total Connect is “Home”, Home Assistant will use alarm_control_panel.home .
The integration provides a binary sensor for each Total Connect zone. To see faulted zones in Home Assistant, your Total Connect account must have “Sensor Activities” enabled. Your alarm monitoring company may charge an extra fee to enable this. If available, these can be found in the Total Connect 2 web portal at Notifications > Sensor Activities . Alternately, they can be found in the Total Connect mobile app at More > Settings > Notifications > Sensor Activities . Enable each zone you want to monitor. Unmonitored zones will display as Closed in Home Assistant.
Home Assistant device class door is assigned to Total Connect entry/exit, perimeter, and motion zones; along with most alarm panel buttons. The sensor will appear as True if the zone is opened (either fault or triggered in Total Connect) and False if closed. Device class smoke is assigned to Total Connect smoke detectors and alarm panel buttons set to a “Fire No Verification” response type. The sensor will appear as True if smoke is detected or the respective button is pressed. Device class gas is assigned to Total Connect carbon monoxide detectors. The sensor will appear as True if carbon monoxide is detected.
The integration provides a bypass button for each zone that can be bypassed. The Bypass All button for the alarm panel will bypass all faulted or troubled zones. The Clear Bypass button for the alarm panel will clear all bypassed zones.
The Total Connect integration Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] provides the following actions. Each link below opens a dedicated page with examples, parameters, and a step-by-step UI walkthrough.
Arm away instant ( totalconnect.arm_away_instant )
Arms the alarm panel in away mode with zero entry delay.
Arm home instant ( totalconnect.arm_home_instant )
Arms the alarm panel in home mode with zero entry delay.
For an overview of every action across all integrations, see the actions reference .
The following diagnostic sensors are available:
Low Battery for Zones and Alarm Panels will be On if the battery is low.
Tamper for Zones and Alarm Panels will be On if in a tampered state.
Power for Alarm Panels will be On if main power is connected or Off if running on the backup battery.

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
Go to Settings > Devices & services and select the integration card.
From the list of devices, select the integration instance you want to remove.
Next to the entry, select the three dots menu. Then, select Delete .
After deleting the integration, go to Total Connect and remove the user account you created for Home Assistant.
Your alarm panel contacts the Total Connect 2.0 server to provide status updates. This is a “polling integration” that contacts the Total Connect 2.0 server every 30 seconds to retrieve the status of your alarm panel and sensors. Home Assistant cannot communicate locally with the alarm panel.
The polling window is 30 seconds. If your door opens and then closes again within 30 seconds, it may not be visible in Home Assistant. Automations based on the short term status of doors and windows are not recommended.
The Total Connect API has limited zone type information. Many zones are simply described as “perimeter” and thus appear as a door in Home Assistant. You may have to manually adjust some entities.
Some alarm panels integrate Z-Wave, cameras, smart locks or garage door openers, and those add-on devices can be controlled by the Total Connect app. This integration does not yet support awareness of or control of these add-on devices.
This integration cannot “trigger” the alarm panel or cause the alarm to sound.
The integration depends on the Total Connect 2.0 servers and your internet connection. Verify your internet is working and check https://status.resideo.com/ for server outages.
The Total Connect API does not fully document all modes of every alarm panel so the integration was developed based on testing with the developers’ own hardware. New or different hardware may result in unknown ResultCode, ArmingState, ZoneType, ZoneStatus or similar messages in the Home Assistant logs. If encountered, please submit an issue for total-connect-client which enables this integration.
