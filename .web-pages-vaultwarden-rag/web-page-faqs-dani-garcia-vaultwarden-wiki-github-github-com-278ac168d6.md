Frequently Asked Questions
Is Vaultwarden associated with the Bitwarden project or Bitwarden, Inc?
Short answer, No .
There sometimes is some contact between the developers of both projects, but there is no collaboration.
Besides that, the Vaultwarden project only uses the web vault provided by Bitwarden, Inc with some patches to make it work with our implementation.
I've found a public Vaultwarden instance. Is it associated with this project? Is it safe to use?
This project does not host any public Vaultwarden instance and we don't endorse the use of any such site either. Cf. #3233 #4142 #4367
I have an issue with a Bitwarden client where do i need to report this?
If you are using Vaultwarden as your server with any official Bitwarden client, you won't be able to report this at Bitwarden as they will close that issue the moment they see your using Vaultwarden, and they are right to do so.
To determine if the issue is server-side or client side please read the following wiki page to help both Vaultwarden and Bitwarden on determining the issue and where and how to report it.

I have a feature request for the web-vault (or any other client)
Unfortunately we can't help here. The Vaultwarden project does not, and probably will never develop a custom client.
We try to stay as close as possible to the upstream client way of working as possible, and since we would only be able to add something to the web-vault, that might even break other clients or cause issues with keeping up-to-date with the upstream web-vault. Therefor we will not add any special or unique feature which needs to be handled client side to Vaultwarden.
When is the next release of Vaultwarden? Can you give an ETA?
There is no release schedule for Vaultwarden. If the maintainers have time and think a new version is warranted then it could be released immediately but given that this is a project done by people in their spare time it could also take a couple of weeks if not months before the next release.
If you "want early access to the newest features, enhancements, or bug fixes" you can always switch to using the testing image, which is always based upon the newest commit. Cf. Which container image to use
Can Vaultwarden connect to an Oracle MySQL V8.x database?
It could happen that you get the following warning when trying to start Vaultwarden when using Oracle MySQL v8.x
[vaultwarden::util][WARN] Can't connect to database, retrying: DieselConError.
[CAUSE] BadConnection(
"Authentication plugin \'caching_sha2_password\' cannot be loaded: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mariadb18/plugin/caching_sha2_password.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory",
)
Oracle MySQL v8.x uses a more secure password hashing method by default, which is good, but currently not supported by our builds.
You need to create the Vaultwarden user in a specific way so that it uses the old native password hashing.
-- Use this on MySQLv8 installations CREATE USER ' vaultwarden '@ ' localhost ' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY ' yourpassword ' ;
If you already created the user and only want to change the hashing method, use the following:
-- Change password type from caching_sha2_password to native ALTER USER ' vaultwarden ' @ ' localhost ' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY ' yourpassword ' ;

My client (Desktop, Mobile, Web) does not work, I can not login or it complains about invalid certificates.
The Bitwarden clients need a secure connection to fully work without any issues. Though some clients can work without a secure connection we do not recommend this.
Most of the time when people are using certificates and still have issues, they are using so called Self-Signed certificates. While those could provide a secure connection, some platforms do not allow or support this.
We recommend to use a service like Lets Encrypt to provide a valid and by most devices by default accepted certificate.
See the following page:

Why do I see no icons for all my vault items?
There are multiple reasons why there is no icon shown.
If it is just for a few of the vault items it could be that we are not able to extract it. Some sites have some protections enabled which causes our implementation to fail. Most of them require Javascript to work.
It could also be that the Vaultwarden server is not able to access the Internet or resolve DNS queries.
You could check the /admin/diagnostics page (See Enabling admin page ) to see if you can resolve DNS queries and have a connection to the Internet.
If that does work, there could also be a firewall or Outgoing Internet Proxy which maybe blocks these requests.
Websocket connections show wrong IP address
This is not something we can fix on our side. The library we use doesn't support any form of X-Forwarded-For or Forward headers.
It will always show the IP of the reverse proxy used unless you run vaultwarden directly without any proxy, or run a transparent proxy, that could cause it to do show the correct IP. It is not an important part to log, and if you use a reverse proxy you can probably also see this request in its logs which will have the correct IP.
Why does Vaultwarden say [INFO] No .env file found. even though I provided one?
While launching, Vaultwarden checks for the existence of a file called .env (if not changed via the environment variable ENV_FILE ) in the current working directory of the process. If you have not provided this file Vaultwarden will simply inform you that it has not found it. This file is not related to the env file you have provided to docker which loads in the environment variables on container creation or the EnvironmentFile used within a systemd .service .
Can i run Vaultwarden as an Azure WebApp
Unfortunately Azure WebApp's uses CIFS/Samba as their volume storage which does not support locking. This causes issues with the SQLite database file.
There are two ways to solve this.
Do not use SQLite, but MariaDB/MySQL or Posgresql as the database backend.
Try to disable WAL using the ENABLE_DB_WAL environment variable by setting it's value to false . This needs to be done on a new file, so you need to remove the previously created db.sqlite3 file and restart the Vaultwarden app again.
I did not find my answer here in the FAQ, what to do next?
Well, please try to search and click through our wonderful Wiki .
If that does not help you, try to look at either Github Discussions or Vaultwarden Forums .
If that also results in no solution, you could try to search the open and closed Issues .
If you still have not found an answer, you can start a topic on either Github Discussions or Vaultwarden Forums , or joins us in our chatroom .
