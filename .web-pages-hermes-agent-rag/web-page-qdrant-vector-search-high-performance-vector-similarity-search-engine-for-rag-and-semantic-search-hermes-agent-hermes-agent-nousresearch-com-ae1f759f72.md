info
The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.
Qdrant - Vector Similarity Search Engine
High-performance vector database written in Rust for production RAG and semantic search.
When to use Qdrant ​
Use Qdrant when:
Building production RAG systems requiring low latency
Need hybrid search (vectors + metadata filtering)
Require horizontal scaling with sharding/replication
Want on-premise deployment with full data control
Need multi-vector storage per record (dense + sparse)
Building real-time recommendation systems
Key features:
Rust-powered : Memory-safe, high performance
Rich filtering : Filter by any payload field during search
Multiple vectors : Dense, sparse, multi-dense per point
Quantization : Scalar, product, binary for memory efficiency
Distributed : Raft consensus, sharding, replication
REST + gRPC : Both APIs with full feature parity
Use alternatives instead:
Chroma : Simpler setup, embedded use cases
FAISS : Maximum raw speed, research/batch processing
Pinecone : Fully managed, zero ops preferred
Weaviate : GraphQL preference, built-in vectorizers

Basic usage ​
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client . models import Distance , VectorParams , PointStruct
# Connect to Qdrant
client = QdrantClient ( host = "localhost" , port = 6333 )
# Create collection
client . create_collection (
collection_name = "documents" ,
vectors_config = VectorParams ( size = 384 , distance = Distance . COSINE )
)
# Insert vectors with payload
client . upsert (
points = [
PointStruct (
id = 1 ,
vector = [ 0.1 , 0.2 , . . . ] , # 384-dim vector
payload = { "title" : "Doc 1" , "category" : "tech" }
) ,
id = 2 ,
vector = [ 0.3 , 0.4 , . . . ] ,
payload = { "title" : "Doc 2" , "category" : "science" }
]
# Search with filtering
results = client . search (
query_vector = [ 0.15 , 0.25 , . . . ] ,
query_filter = {
"must" : [ { "key" : "category" , "match" : { "value" : "tech" } } ]
} ,
limit = 10
for point in results :
print ( f"ID: { point . id } , Score: { point . score } , Payload: { point . payload } " )
Core concepts ​
Points - Basic data unit ​
from qdrant_client . models import PointStruct
# Point = ID + Vector(s) + Payload
point = PointStruct (
id = 123 , # Integer or UUID string
vector = [ 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , . . . ] , # Dense vector
payload = { # Arbitrary JSON metadata
"title" : "Document title" ,
"category" : "tech" ,
"timestamp" : 1699900000 ,
"tags" : [ "python" , "ml" ]
}
# Batch upsert (recommended)
points = [ point1 , point2 , point3 ] ,
wait = True # Wait for indexing
Collections - Vector containers ​
from qdrant_client . models import VectorParams , Distance , HnswConfigDiff
# Create with HNSW configuration
vectors_config = VectorParams (
size = 384 , # Vector dimensions
distance = Distance . COSINE # COSINE, EUCLID, DOT, MANHATTAN
hnsw_config = HnswConfigDiff (
m = 16 , # Connections per node (default 16)
ef_construct = 100 , # Build-time accuracy (default 100)
full_scan_threshold = 10000 # Switch to brute force below this
on_disk_payload = True # Store payload on disk
# Collection info
info = client . get_collection ( "documents" )
print ( f"Points: { info . points_count } , Vectors: { info . vectors_count } " )
Distance metrics ​
Metric Use Case Range COSINE Text embeddings, normalized vectors 0 to 2 EUCLID Spatial data, image features 0 to ∞ DOT Recommendations, unnormalized -∞ to ∞ MANHATTAN Sparse features, discrete data 0 to ∞
Search operations ​
Basic search ​
# Simple nearest neighbor search
query_vector = [ 0.1 , 0.2 , . . . ] ,
limit = 10 ,
with_payload = True ,
with_vectors = False # Don't return vectors (faster)
Filtered search ​
from qdrant_client . models import Filter , FieldCondition , MatchValue , Range
# Complex filtering
query_vector = query_embedding ,
query_filter = Filter (
must = [
FieldCondition ( key = "category" , match = MatchValue ( value = "tech" ) ) ,
FieldCondition ( key = "timestamp" , range = Range ( gte = 1699000000 ) )
] ,
must_not = [
FieldCondition ( key = "status" , match = MatchValue ( value = "archived" ) )
# Shorthand filter syntax
"must" : [
{ "key" : "category" , "match" : { "value" : "tech" } } ,
{ "key" : "price" , "range" : { "gte" : 10 , "lte" : 100 } }
Batch search ​
from qdrant_client . models import SearchRequest
# Multiple queries in one request
results = client . search_batch (
requests = [
SearchRequest ( vector = [ 0.1 , . . . ] , limit = 5 ) ,
SearchRequest ( vector = [ 0.2 , . . . ] , limit = 5 , filter = { "must" : [ . . . ] } ) ,
SearchRequest ( vector = [ 0.3 , . . . ] , limit = 10 )
RAG integration ​
With sentence-transformers ​
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from qdrant_client . models import VectorParams , Distance , PointStruct
# Initialize
encoder = SentenceTransformer ( "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" )
collection_name = "knowledge_base" ,
# Index documents
documents = [
{ "id" : 1 , "text" : "Python is a programming language" , "source" : "wiki" } ,
{ "id" : 2 , "text" : "Machine learning uses algorithms" , "source" : "textbook" } ,
id = doc [ "id" ] ,
vector = encoder . encode ( doc [ "text" ] ) . tolist ( ) ,
payload = { "text" : doc [ "text" ] , "source" : doc [ "source" ] }
for doc in documents
client . upsert ( collection_name = "knowledge_base" , points = points )
# RAG retrieval
def retrieve ( query : str , top_k : int = 5 ) - > list [ dict ] :
query_vector = encoder . encode ( query ) . tolist ( )
query_vector = query_vector ,
limit = top_k
return [ { "text" : r . payload [ "text" ] , "score" : r . score } for r in results ]
# Use in RAG pipeline
context = retrieve ( "What is Python?" )
prompt = f"Context: { context } \n\nQuestion: What is Python?"
With LangChain ​
from langchain_community . vectorstores import Qdrant
from langchain_community . embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings ( model_name = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" )
vectorstore = Qdrant . from_documents ( documents , embeddings , url = "http://localhost:6333" , collection_name = "docs" )
retriever = vectorstore . as_retriever ( search_kwargs = { "k" : 5 } )
With LlamaIndex ​
from llama_index . vector_stores . qdrant import QdrantVectorStore
from llama_index . core import VectorStoreIndex , StorageContext
vector_store = QdrantVectorStore ( client = client , collection_name = "llama_docs" )
storage_context = StorageContext . from_defaults ( vector_store = vector_store )
index = VectorStoreIndex . from_documents ( documents , storage_context = storage_context )
query_engine = index . as_query_engine ( )
Multi-vector support ​
Named vectors (different embedding models) ​
from qdrant_client . models import VectorParams , Distance
# Collection with multiple vector types
collection_name = "hybrid_search" ,
vectors_config = {
"dense" : VectorParams ( size = 384 , distance = Distance . COSINE ) ,
"sparse" : VectorParams ( size = 30000 , distance = Distance . DOT )
# Insert with named vectors
vector = {
"dense" : dense_embedding ,
"sparse" : sparse_embedding
payload = { "text" : "document text" }
# Search specific vector
query_vector = ( "dense" , query_dense ) , # Specify which vector
Sparse vectors (BM25, SPLADE) ​
from qdrant_client . models import SparseVectorParams , SparseIndexParams , SparseVector
# Collection with sparse vectors
collection_name = "sparse_search" ,
vectors_config = { } ,
sparse_vectors_config = { "text" : SparseVectorParams ( index = SparseIndexParams ( on_disk = False ) ) }
# Insert sparse vector
points = [ PointStruct ( id = 1 , vector = { "text" : SparseVector ( indices = [ 1 , 5 , 100 ] , values = [ 0.5 , 0.8 , 0.2 ] ) } , payload = { "text" : "document" } ) ]
Quantization (memory optimization) ​
from qdrant_client . models import ScalarQuantization , ScalarQuantizationConfig , ScalarType
# Scalar quantization (4x memory reduction)
collection_name = "quantized" ,
vectors_config = VectorParams ( size = 384 , distance = Distance . COSINE ) ,
quantization_config = ScalarQuantization (
scalar = ScalarQuantizationConfig (
type = ScalarType . INT8 ,
quantile = 0.99 , # Clip outliers
always_ram = True # Keep quantized in RAM
# Search with rescoring
query_vector = query ,
search_params = { "quantization" : { "rescore" : True } } , # Rescore top results
Payload indexing ​
from qdrant_client . models import PayloadSchemaType
# Create payload index for faster filtering
client . create_payload_index (
field_name = "category" ,
field_schema = PayloadSchemaType . KEYWORD
field_name = "timestamp" ,
field_schema = PayloadSchemaType . INTEGER
# Index types: KEYWORD, INTEGER, FLOAT, GEO, TEXT (full-text), BOOL
Production deployment ​
Qdrant Cloud ​
# Connect to Qdrant Cloud
client = QdrantClient (
url = "https://your-cluster.cloud.qdrant.io" ,
api_key = "your-api-key"
Performance tuning ​
# Optimize for search speed (higher recall)
client . update_collection (
hnsw_config = HnswConfigDiff ( ef_construct = 200 , m = 32 )
# Optimize for indexing speed (bulk loads)
optimizer_config = { "indexing_threshold" : 20000 }
Best practices ​
Batch operations - Use batch upsert/search for efficiency
Payload indexing - Index fields used in filters
Quantization - Enable for large collections (>1M vectors)
Sharding - Use for collections >10M vectors
On-disk storage - Enable on_disk_payload for large payloads
Connection pooling - Reuse client instances
Common issues ​
Slow search with filters:
# Create payload index for filtered fields
collection_name = "docs" ,
Out of memory:
# Enable quantization and on-disk storage
collection_name = "large_collection" ,
quantization_config = ScalarQuantization ( . . . ) ,
on_disk_payload = True
Connection issues:
# Use timeout and retry
host = "localhost" ,
port = 6333 ,
timeout = 30 ,
prefer_grpc = True # gRPC for better performance
