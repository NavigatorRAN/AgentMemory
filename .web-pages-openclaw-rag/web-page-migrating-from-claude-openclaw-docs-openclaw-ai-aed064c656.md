## Description

Move Claude Code and Claude Desktop local state into OpenClaw with a previewed import

## Extracted Text

Close
Install Maintenance
OpenClaw imports local Claude state through the bundled Claude migration provider. The provider previews every item before changing state, redacts secrets in plans and reports, and creates a verified backup before apply.
Note
Onboarding imports require a fresh OpenClaw setup. If you already have local OpenClaw state, reset config, credentials, sessions, and the workspace first, or use openclaw migrate directly with --overwrite after reviewing the plan.
Two ways to import
Onboarding wizard
The wizard offers Claude when it detects local Claude state.
bash Copy code openclaw onboard --flow import
Or point at a specific source:
bash Copy code openclaw onboard --import-from claude --import-source ~/.claude
CLI
Use openclaw migrate for scripted or repeatable runs. See openclaw migrate for the full reference.
bash Copy code openclaw migrate claude --dry-run openclaw migrate apply claude -- yes
Add --from <path> to import a specific Claude Code home or project root.
What gets imported
Instructions and memory
Project CLAUDE.md and .claude/CLAUDE.md content is copied or appended into the OpenClaw agent workspace AGENTS.md .
User ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md content is appended into workspace USER.md .
MCP servers
MCP server definitions are imported from project .mcp.json , Claude Code ~/.claude.json , and Claude Desktop claude_desktop_config.json when present.
Skills and commands
Claude skills with a SKILL.md file are copied into the OpenClaw workspace skills directory.
Claude command Markdown files under .claude/commands/ or ~/.claude/commands/ are converted into OpenClaw skills with disable-model-invocation: true .
What stays archive-only
The provider copies these into the migration report for manual review, but does not load them into live OpenClaw config:
Claude hooks
Claude permissions and broad tool allowlists
Claude environment defaults
CLAUDE.local.md
.claude/rules/
Claude subagents under .claude/agents/ or ~/.claude/agents/
Claude Code caches, plans, and project history directories
Claude Desktop extensions and OS-stored credentials
OpenClaw refuses to execute hooks, trust permission allowlists, or decode opaque OAuth and Desktop credential state automatically. Move what you need by hand after reviewing the archive.
Source selection
Without --from , OpenClaw inspects the default Claude Code home at ~/.claude , the sampled Claude Code ~/.claude.json state file, and the Claude Desktop MCP config on macOS.
When --from points at a project root, OpenClaw imports only that project's Claude files such as CLAUDE.md , .claude/settings.json , .claude/commands/ , .claude/skills/ , and .mcp.json . It does not read your global Claude home during a project-root import.
Recommended flow
Preview the plan
bash Copy code openclaw migrate claude --dry-run
The plan lists everything that will change, including conflicts, skipped items, and sensitive values redacted from nested MCP env or headers fields.
Apply with backup
bash Copy code openclaw migrate apply claude -- yes
OpenClaw creates and verifies a backup before applying.
Run doctor
bash Copy code openclaw doctor
Doctor checks for config or state issues after the import.
Restart and verify
bash Copy code openclaw gateway restart openclaw status
Confirm the gateway is healthy and your imported instructions, MCP servers, and skills are loaded.
Conflict handling
Apply refuses to continue when the plan reports conflicts (a file or config value already exists at the target).
Warning
Rerun with --overwrite only when replacing the existing target is intentional. Providers may still write item-level backups for overwritten files in the migration report directory.
For a fresh OpenClaw install, conflicts are unusual. They typically appear when you re-run the import on a setup that already has user edits.
JSON output for automation
bash Copy code openclaw migrate claude --dry-run --json openclaw migrate apply claude --json -- yes
With --json and no --yes , apply prints the plan and does not mutate state. This is the safest mode for CI and shared scripts.
Troubleshooting
Claude state lives outside ~/.claude
Pass --from /actual/path (CLI) or --import-source /actual/path (onboarding).
Onboarding refuses to import on an existing setup
Onboarding imports require a fresh setup. Either reset state and re-onboard, or use openclaw migrate apply claude directly, which supports --overwrite and explicit backup control.
MCP servers from Claude Desktop did not import
Claude Desktop reads claude_desktop_config.json from a platform-specific path. Point --from at that file's directory if OpenClaw did not detect it automatically.
Claude commands became skills with model invocation disabled
By design. Claude commands are user-triggered, so OpenClaw imports them as skills with disable-model-invocation: true . Edit each skill's frontmatter if you want the agent to invoke them automatically.
