The motionEye integration Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] allows you to integrate your
motionEye server into Home Assistant. motionEye
is an open source web-frontend for the motion daemon, used to centralize the management
and visualization of multiple types of cameras.
To add the motionEye hub to your Home Assistant instance, use this My button:
Manual configuration steps
If the above My button doesn’t work, you can also perform the following steps
manually:
Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
Go to Settings > Devices & services .
In the bottom right corner, select the
Add Integration button.
From the list, select motionEye .
Follow the instructions on screen to complete the setup.
url
The URL of the motionEye server itself – not the URL for the camera stream(s) that it makes available.
admin_username
The username of the motionEye administrative account, used for changing camera settings.
admin_password
The password of the motionEye administrative account.
surveillance_username
The username of the motionEye surveillance user, used to authenticate video streams.
surveillance_password
The password of the motionEye surveillance account.
To define options for motionEye, follow these steps:
In Home Assistant, go to Settings > Devices & services .
If multiple instances of motionEye are configured, choose the instance you want to configure.
On the card, select the cogwheel .
If the card does not have a cogwheel, the integration does not support options for this device.
Edit the options, then select Submit to save the changes.
Configure motionEye webhooks to report events to Home Assistant
Whether or not motionEye webhooks should be configured to callback into Home Assistant. If this option is disabled, no motion detected or file stored events will be generated unless the webhooks are manually configured.
Overwrite unrecognized webhooks
Whether or not to overwrite webhooks that are already configured and are not recognized as belonging to this integration (webhooks are deemed to belong to this integration if they contain src=hass-motioneye in the query string).
Stream URL template
A jinja2 template that is used to override the standard MJPEG stream URL (e.g. for use with reverse proxies). See Camera MJPEG Streams below.
Platform Description camera An MJPEG camera that shows the motionEye video stream. switch Switch entities to enable/disable motion detection, text overlay, video streaming, still image capture, movie capture and upload enabled. sensor An “action sensor” that shows the number of configured actions for this device. The names of the available actions are viewable in the actions attribute of the sensor entity.
Note :
If the video streaming switch is turned off, the camera entity, and actions that operate on that camera, will become unavailable. The rest of the integration will continue to function.
As cameras are added or removed to motionEye, devices/entities are automatically added or removed from Home Assistant.
Camera MJPEG Streams
In order for the MJPEG streams to function they need to be accessible at
<motioneyehost>:<streaming port> , that is, Home Assistant will directly connect to the streaming port
that is configured in the motionEye UI (under Video Streaming ) on the host that the
motionEye integration is configured to use.
Example:
If this integration is configured to talk to motionEye at http://motioneye:8765 , and
a camera is configured to stream on port 8081 – Home Assistant needs to
be able to communicate to motioneye port 8081 .
Stream URL Template
For advanced usecases, this behavior can be changed with the Stream URL
template option. When set, this string will override the default
stream address that is derived from the default behavior described above. This
option supports jinja2 templates and has
the camera dict variables from motionEye
( example )
available for the template. Note that no Home Assistant state is available to
the template, only the camera dict from motionEye.
This is very useful when motionEye is behind a custom configured reverse proxy,
and/or when the stream ports are otherwise not accessible to Home Assistant
(e.g. firewall rules).
Stream URL Template Examples
The below are useful examples of how this option may be set.
Use the camera name in the stream URL :
http://motioneye/video/{{ name }}
Use the camera name in the stream URL, converting it to lowercase first :
http://motioneye/video/{{ name|lower }}
Use the camera id in the stream URL :
http://motioneye/video/{{ id }}
On receipt of a motion or file stored callbacks, events will be fired which can be used
in automations (etc).
Data in events
The event data includes the Home Assistant device_id for this motionEye
camera device and the Home Assistant device name .
Event data also includes as many Motion Conversion
Specifiers
as make sense for that event type.
Any additional &key=value pairs added manually to the motionEye webhook
(in the motionEye UI) will automatically propagate to the event data. If
you manually tweak the webhook, remove the src=hass-motioneye parameter
or the webhook will be overwritten.
For file storage events, the integration will automatically add
media_content_id (an identifier that can be used to play the media in a
Home Assistant media player) and file_url (a raw URL to the media). See
example automation below for an illustration of how
this can be used.
file_type will be less than 8 if the media stored is an image, otherwise,
it is a movie/video. See the motion
source
for more details.
Example motion detected event

The motionEye integration Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] provides the following actions. Each link below opens a dedicated page with examples, parameters, and a step-by-step UI walkthrough.
Trigger motionEye action ( motioneye.action )
Triggers a motionEye action.
Set text overlay ( motioneye.set_text_overlay )
Sets the text overlay for a camera.
Snapshot ( motioneye.snapshot )
Triggers a motionEye still snapshot.
For an overview of every action across all integrations, see the actions reference .
Saved motionEye media (movies and images) can be natively browsed from the Home Assistant “Media
Browser”.
While this integration allows drilling down into the media for each camera separately,
underneath motionEye is using the directory structure to associate media items to each
individual camera. Thus if multiple cameras are manually configured to share the same
root directory, motionEye will return the combination of the media items when any one
of the “overlapping” cameras are queried. Use different root directories (in motionEye:
File Storage -> Root Directory ) to ensure motionEye (and thus this integration) will
correctly associate media with the camera from which that media was captured.
A dashboard card with icons that will call the action action to send action commands to motionEye.

A simple automation to set text overlay indicating the alarm armed status. Text overlay
must be switched on for this automation to work (controllable via switch.<name>_text_overlay ).

An automation to cast stored movie clips to a TV as they arrive.
- alias : " Cast motionEye movie clips" triggers : - trigger : event event_type : motioneye.file_stored event_data : # Only cast video. file_type : " 8" actions : - action : media_player.play_media target : entity_id : media_player.kitchen_tv data : media_content_id : " {{ trigger.event.data.media_content_id }}" media_content_type : video
To enable debug logging for both the integration and the underlying client library,
enable the following in your configuration.yaml The configuration.yaml file is the main configuration file for Home Assistant. It lists the integrations to be loaded and their specific configurations. In some cases, the configuration needs to be edited manually directly in the configuration.yaml file. Most integrations can be configured in the UI. [Learn more] and then restart:
logger : default : warning logs : motioneye_client : debug homeassistant.components.motioneye : debug
