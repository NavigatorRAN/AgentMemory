## Description

Use Kilo Gateway's unified API to access many models in OpenClaw

## Extracted Text

Models Providers
Kilo Gateway provides a unified API that routes requests to many models behind a single
endpoint and API key. It is OpenAI-compatible, so most OpenAI SDKs work by switching the base URL.
Property Value Provider kilocode Auth KILOCODE_API_KEY API OpenAI-compatible Base URL https://api.kilo.ai/api/gateway/
Install plugin
Install the official plugin, then restart Gateway:
bash Copy code openclaw plugins install @openclaw/kilocode-provider openclaw gateway restart
Getting started
Create an account
Go to app.kilo.ai , sign in or create an account, then navigate to API Keys and generate a new key.
Run onboarding
bash Copy code openclaw onboard --auth-choice kilocode-api-key
Or set the environment variable directly:
bash Copy code export KILOCODE_API_KEY= "<your-kilocode-api-key>" # pragma: allowlist secret
Verify the model is available
bash Copy code openclaw models list --provider kilocode
Default model
The default model is kilocode/kilo/auto , a provider-owned smart-routing
model managed by Kilo Gateway.
Note
OpenClaw treats kilocode/kilo/auto as the stable default ref, but does not
publish a source-backed task-to-upstream-model mapping for that route. Exact
upstream routing behind kilocode/kilo/auto is owned by Kilo Gateway, not
hard-coded in OpenClaw.
Built-in catalog
OpenClaw dynamically discovers available models from the Kilo Gateway at startup. Use
/models kilocode to see the full list of models available with your account.
Any model available on the gateway can be used with the kilocode/ prefix:
Model ref Notes kilocode/kilo/auto Default — smart routing kilocode/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 Anthropic via Kilo kilocode/openai/gpt-5.5 OpenAI via Kilo kilocode/google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview Google via Kilo ...and many more Use /models kilocode to list all
Tip
At startup, OpenClaw queries GET https://api.kilo.ai/api/gateway/models and merges
discovered models ahead of the static fallback catalog. The static fallback always
includes kilocode/kilo/auto ( Kilo Auto ) with input: ["text", "image"] ,
reasoning: true , contextWindow: 1000000 , and maxTokens: 128000 .
Config example
json5 Copy code { env : { KILOCODE_API_KEY : "<your-kilocode-api-key>" }, // pragma: allowlist secret agents : { defaults : { model : { primary : "kilocode/kilo/auto" }, }, }, }
Transport and compatibility
Kilo Gateway is documented in source as OpenRouter-compatible, so it stays on
the proxy-style OpenAI-compatible path rather than native OpenAI request shaping.
Gemini-backed Kilo refs stay on the proxy-Gemini path, so OpenClaw keeps
Gemini thought-signature sanitation there without enabling native Gemini
replay validation or bootstrap rewrites.
Kilo Gateway uses a Bearer token with your API key under the hood.
Stream wrapper and reasoning
Kilo's shared stream wrapper adds the provider app header and normalizes
proxy reasoning payloads for supported concrete model refs.
Warning
kilocode/kilo/auto and other proxy-reasoning-unsupported hints skip reasoning
injection. If you need reasoning support, use a concrete model ref such as
kilocode/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 .
Troubleshooting
If model discovery fails at startup, OpenClaw falls back to the static catalog containing kilocode/kilo/auto .
Confirm your API key is valid and that your Kilo account has the desired models enabled.
When the Gateway runs as a daemon, ensure KILOCODE_API_KEY is available to that process (for example in ~/.openclaw/.env or via env.shellEnv ).
