New FAQs are appended to the bottom of this section.
What distribution is Proxmox VE based on?
Proxmox VE is based on Debian GNU/Linux
What license does the Proxmox VE project use?
Proxmox VE code is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License,
version 3.
Will Proxmox VE run on a 32bit processor?
Proxmox VE works only on 64-bit CPUs (AMD or Intel). There is no plan
for 32-bit for the platform.
VMs and Containers can be both 32-bit and 64-bit.
Does my CPU support virtualization?
To check if your CPU is virtualization compatible, check for the vmx
or svm tag in this command output:
egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
Supported Intel CPUs
64-bit processors with
Intel
Virtualization Technology (Intel VT-x) support.
( List of processors with Intel VT and 64-bit )
Supported AMD CPUs
AMD
Virtualization Technology (AMD-V) support.
What is a container/virtual environment (VE)/virtual private server (VPS)?
In the context of containers, these terms all refer to the concept of
operating-system-level virtualization. Operating-system-level virtualization is
a method of virtualization, in which the kernel of an operating system
allows for multiple isolated instances, that all share the kernel. When
referring to LXC, we call such instances containers. Because containers use the
host’s kernel rather than emulating a full operating system, they require less
overhead, but are limited to Linux guests.
What is a QEMU/KVM guest (or VM)?
A QEMU/KVM guest (or VM) is a guest system running virtualized under
Proxmox VE using QEMU and the Linux KVM kernel module.
What is QEMU?
QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and
virtualizer. QEMU uses the Linux KVM kernel module to achieve near
native performance by executing the guest code directly on the host
CPU.
It is not limited to Linux guests but allows arbitrary operating systems
to run.
How long will my Proxmox VE version be supported?
Proxmox VE versions are supported at least as long as the corresponding Debian
version is supported by the Debian Security Team, i.e. approximately 3 years
after its initial release, see
Debian lifespan . Proxmox VE uses a
rolling release model and using the latest stable version is always
recommended.

How can I upgrade Proxmox VE to the next point release?
Minor version upgrades, for example upgrading from Proxmox VE in version 8.1
to 8.2 or 8.3, can be done just like any normal update.
But you should still check the release notes
for any relevant notable, or breaking change.
For the update itself use either the Web UI Node → Updates panel or
through the CLI with:
apt update
apt full-upgrade
Always ensure you correctly setup the
package repositories and only
continue with the actual upgrade if apt update did not hit any error.
How can I upgrade Proxmox VE to the next major release?
Major version upgrades, for example going from Proxmox VE 8.4 to 9.0, are also
supported.
They must be carefully planned and tested and should never be started without
having a current backup ready.
Although the specific upgrade steps depend on your respective setup, we provide
general instructions and advice on how an upgrade should be performed:
Upgrade from Proxmox VE 8 to 9
Upgrade from Proxmox VE 7 to 8
Upgrade from Proxmox VE 6 to 7
Upgrade from Proxmox VE 5 to 6
Upgrade from Proxmox VE 4 to 5
Upgrade from Proxmox VE 3 to 4
LXC vs LXD vs Proxmox Containers vs Docker
LXC is a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment
features. Through a powerful API and simple tools, it lets Linux users
easily create and manage system containers. LXC, as well as the former
OpenVZ, aims at system virtualization . Thus, it allows you to run a
complete OS inside a container, where you log in using ssh, add users,
run apache, etc…
LXD is built on top of LXC to provide a new, better user
experience. Under the hood, LXD uses LXC through liblxc and its Go
binding to create and manage the containers. It’s basically an
alternative to LXC’s tools and distribution template system with the
added features that come from being controllable over the network.
Proxmox Containers are how we refer to containers that are created and managed
using the Proxmox Container Toolkit ( pct ). They also target system
virtualization and use LXC as the basis of the container offering. With the
addition of OCI image support (technology preview), Proxmox VE can also create
containers from OCI images, including full system containers but also
application containers (tech preview).
The Proxmox Container Toolkit ( pct ) is tightly coupled with Proxmox VE. This means
that it is aware of cluster setups, and it can use the same network and storage
resources as QEMU virtual machines (VMs). You can even use the Proxmox VE firewall,
create and restore backups, or manage containers using the HA framework.
Everything can be controlled over the network using the Proxmox VE API.
Docker aims at running a single application in an isolated, self-contained
environment. These are generally referred to as “Application Containers”, rather
than “System Containers”. You manage a Docker instance from the host, using the
Docker Engine command-line interface. It is not recommended to run docker
directly on your Proxmox VE host.
While it can be convenient to run “Application Containers” directly as
Proxmox Containers, doing so is currently a tech preview. For use cases
requiring container orchestration or live migration, it is still recommended to
run them inside a Proxmox QEMU virtual machine.
