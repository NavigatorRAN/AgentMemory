The PlayStation Network integration Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] enables you to seamlessly integrate information from your currently playing game in Home Assistant.
PlayStation Network (PSN) is a digital media entertainment service provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment . It allows users to enjoy a variety of gaming-related services such as purchasing games, downloading content, and connecting with other players.
The PlayStation Network integration Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more. [Learn more] lets you integrate information about your currently playing game into Home Assistant. You can display the game title and cover art in your Home Assistant dashboards.
To set up the PlayStation Network integration, you must first have an active PlayStation Network account. You can register for an account at the Official PlayStation® Site .
During the setup process in Home Assistant, you will be asked to provide your NPSSO token. You will need to be logged into playstation.com to access the token in your browser. You will find a link to retrieve the token in the config flow.
The NPSSO token is valid for two months. Once it expires, the integration will automatically prompt you to re-authenticate.
Note
After retrieving the NPSSO token, do not log out of the PlayStation website. Logging out will invalidate the token and re-authentication is required on the next Home Assistant reboot or after up to 7 days.
It is recommended, especially if you have configured multiple PlayStation accounts in Home Assistant, to retrieve the token using an incognito or private browser window and close it afterward.
To add the PlayStation Network hub to your Home Assistant instance, use this My button:
PlayStation Network can be auto-discovered by Home Assistant. If an instance was found,
it will be shown as Discovered . You can then set it up right away.
Manual configuration steps
If it wasn’t discovered automatically, don’t worry! You can set up a
manual integration entry:
Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
Go to Settings > Devices & services .
In the bottom right corner, select the
Add Integration button.
From the list, select PlayStation Network .
Follow the instructions on screen to complete the setup.

This integration retrieves data from the PlayStation Network every 30 seconds to ensure timely updates.
Friend status updates occur every 180 seconds. If more than 20 friends are configured, the update interval will be gradually increased to avoid exceeding API rate limits.
PlayStation Network imposes a rate limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes.
This integration makes 3 requests per data update (every 30 seconds). This presently is well under the rate limit, but leaves room to add additional requests as the integration develops.
Please keep these limits in mind to avoid exceeding the PlayStation Network request allowance.
The Active state for each device is only reported via the API for the last used device. For example, if you start playing a game on your PS4 and without powering down, launch a game on your PS5, the API will only report your PS5 status.
The following devices are known to be supported by the integration:
PlayStation 5
PlayStation 4
PlayStation 3
PlayStation Vita
PlayStation PC
The following devices are not supported by the integration:
PlayStation Portable
Other PlayStation system variants (PlayStation TV) or older systems that do not support the PlayStation Network
You can display your currently playing game as artwork on your dashboard.
This integration can be removed by following these steps:
Go to Settings > Devices & services and select the integration card.
From the list of devices, select the integration instance you want to remove.
Next to the entry, select the three dots menu. Then, select Delete .
