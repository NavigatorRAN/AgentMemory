## Description

How active-run steering queues messages at runtime boundaries

Agents Messages and delivery
When a normal prompt arrives while a session run is already streaming, OpenClaw
tries to send that prompt into the active runtime by default when the queue mode
is steer . No config entry and no queue directive are required for that default
behavior. OpenClaw and the native Codex app-server harness implement the delivery
details differently.
Runtime boundary
Steering does not interrupt a tool call that is already running. OpenClaw checks for
queued steering messages at model boundaries:
The assistant asks for tool calls.
OpenClaw executes the current assistant message's tool-call batch.
OpenClaw emits the turn end event.
OpenClaw drains queued steering messages.
OpenClaw appends those messages as user messages before the next LLM call.
This keeps tool results paired with the assistant message that requested them,
then lets the next model call see the latest user input.
The native Codex app-server harness exposes turn/steer instead of OpenClaw runtime's
internal steering queue. OpenClaw batches queued prompts for the configured
quiet window, then sends a single turn/steer request with all collected user
input in arrival order.
Codex review and manual compaction turns reject same-turn steering. When a
runtime cannot accept steering in steer mode, OpenClaw waits for the active
run to finish before starting the prompt.
This page explains queue-mode steering for normal inbound messages when the mode
is steer . If the mode is followup or collect , normal messages do not enter
this steering path; they wait until the active run finishes. For the explicit
/steer <message> command, see Steer .
Modes
Mode Active-run behavior Later behavior steer Steers the prompt into the active runtime when it can. Waits for the active run to finish if steering is unavailable. followup Does not steer. Runs queued messages later after the active run ends. collect Does not steer. Coalesces compatible queued messages into one later turn after the debounce window. interrupt Aborts the active run instead of steering it. Starts the newest message after aborting.
Burst example
If four users send messages while the agent is executing a tool call:
With default behavior, the active runtime receives all four messages in
arrival order before its next model decision. OpenClaw drains them at the next model
boundary; Codex receives them as one batched turn/steer .
With /queue collect , OpenClaw does not steer. It waits until the active run
ends, then creates a followup turn with compatible queued messages after the
debounce window.
With /queue interrupt , OpenClaw aborts the active run and starts the newest
message instead of steering.
Scope
Steering always targets the current active session run. It does not create a new
session, change the active run's tool policy, or split messages by sender. In
multi-user channels, inbound prompts already include sender and route context, so
the next model call can see who sent each message.
Use followup or collect when you want messages to queue by default instead
of steering the active run. Use interrupt when the newest prompt should
replace the active run.
Debounce
messages.queue.debounceMs applies to queued followup and collect delivery.
In steer mode with the native Codex harness, it also sets the quiet window
before sending batched turn/steer . For OpenClaw, active steering itself does not use
the debounce timer because OpenClaw naturally batches messages until the next model
boundary.
