The Proxmox VE storage model is very flexible. Virtual machine images
can either be stored on one or several local storages, or on shared
storage like NFS or iSCSI (NAS, SAN). There are no limits, and you may
configure as many storage pools as you like. You can use all
storage technologies available for Debian Linux.
One major benefit of storing VMs on shared storage is the ability to
live-migrate running machines without any downtime, as all nodes in
the cluster have direct access to VM disk images. There is no need to
copy VM image data, so live migration is very fast in that case.
The storage library (package libpve-storage-perl ) uses a flexible
plugin system to provide a common interface to all storage types. This
can be easily adopted to include further storage types in the future.
Storage Types
There are basically two different classes of storage types:
File level storage
File level based storage technologies allow access to a fully featured (POSIX)
file system. They are in general more flexible than any Block level storage
(see below), and allow you to store content of any type. ZFS is probably the
most advanced system, and it has full support for snapshots and clones.
Block level storage
Allows to store large raw images. It is usually not possible to store
other files (ISO, backups, ..) on such storage types. Most modern
block level storage implementations support snapshots and clones.
Ceph RADOS is a distributed systems, replicating storage data to different
nodes that can be accessed as RBD (RADOS Block Device).

1 : Disk images for VMs are stored in ZFS volume (zvol) datasets, which provide
block device functionality.
2 : On file based storages, snapshots are possible with the qcow2 format,
either using the internal snapshot function, or snapshots as volume chains 4 .
Creating and deleting internal qcow2 snapshots will block a running VM and
is not an efficient operation. The performance is particularly bad with network
storages like NFS. On some setups and for large disks (multiple hundred GiB or
TiB sized), these operations may take several minutes, or in extreme cases, even
hours. If your setup is affected, create and remove snapshots while the VM is
shut down, expecting a long task duration.
3 : It is possible to use LVM on top of an iSCSI or FC-based storage.
That way you get a shared LVM storage
4 : Since Proxmox VE 9, snapshots as a volume chain have been available for VMs.
These snapshots use separate volumes for the snapshot data and layer them. For
more details, see the description for snapshot-as-volume-chain in the
LVM configuration section.
5 Technology preview with best-effort support.
Thin Provisioning
A number of storages, and the QEMU image format qcow2 , support thin
provisioning . With thin provisioning activated, only the blocks that
the guest system actually use will be written to the storage.
Say for instance you create a VM with a 32GB hard disk, and after
installing the guest system OS, the root file system of the VM contains
3 GB of data. In that case only 3GB are written to the storage, even
if the guest VM sees a 32GB hard drive. In this way thin provisioning
allows you to create disk images which are larger than the currently
available storage blocks. You can create large disk images for your
VMs, and when the need arises, add more disks to your storage without
resizing the VMs' file systems.
All storage types which have the “Snapshots” feature also support thin
provisioning.
If a storage runs full, all guests using volumes on that
storage receive IO errors. This can cause file system inconsistencies
and may corrupt your data. So it is advisable to avoid
over-provisioning of your storage resources, or carefully observe
free space to avoid such conditions.
Storage Configuration
All Proxmox VE related storage configuration is stored within a single text
file at /etc/pve/storage.cfg . As this file is within /etc/pve/ , it
gets automatically distributed to all cluster nodes. So all nodes
share the same storage configuration.
Sharing storage configuration makes perfect sense for shared storage,
because the same “shared” storage is accessible from all nodes. But it is
also useful for local storage types. In this case such local storage
is available on all nodes, but it is physically different and can have
totally different content.
Storage Pools
Each storage pool has a <type> , and is uniquely identified by its
<STORAGE_ID> . A pool configuration looks like this:
<type>: <STORAGE_ID>
<property> <value>
<property>
...
The <type>: <STORAGE_ID> line starts the pool definition, which is then
followed by a list of properties. Most properties require a value. Some have
reasonable defaults, in which case you can omit the value.
To be more specific, take a look at the default storage configuration
after installation. It contains one special local storage pool named
local , which refers to the directory /var/lib/vz and is always
available. The Proxmox VE installer creates additional storage entries
depending on the storage type chosen at installation time.
Default storage configuration ( /etc/pve/storage.cfg )
dir: local
path /var/lib/vz
content iso,vztmpl,backup
# default image store on LVM based installation
lvmthin: local-lvm
thinpool data
vgname pve
content rootdir,images
# default image store on ZFS based installation
zfspool: local-zfs
pool rpool/data
sparse
content images,rootdir
It is problematic to have multiple storage configurations pointing to
the exact same underlying storage. Such an aliased storage configuration can
lead to two different volume IDs ( volid ) pointing to the exact same disk
image. Proxmox VE expects that the images' volume IDs point to, are unique. Choosing
different content types for aliased storage configurations can be fine, but
is not recommended.
Common Storage Properties
A few storage properties are common among different storage types.
nodes
List of cluster node names where this storage is
usable/accessible. One can use this property to restrict storage
access to a limited set of nodes.
content
A storage can support several content types, for example virtual disk
images, cdrom iso images, container templates or container root
directories. Not all storage types support all content types. One can set
this property to select what this storage is used for.
images
QEMU/KVM VM images.
rootdir
Allow to store container data.
vztmpl
Container templates.
backup
Backup files ( vzdump ).
iso
ISO images
snippets
Snippet files, for example guest hook scripts
import
OVAs and VM disk images that can be imported from this storage
shared
Indicate that this is a single storage with the same contents on all nodes (or
all listed in the nodes option). It will not make the contents of a local
storage automatically accessible to other nodes, it just marks an already shared
storage as such!
disable
You can use this flag to disable the storage completely.
prune-backups
Retention options for backups. For details, see
Backup Retention .
format
Default image format ( raw|qcow2|vmdk )
preallocation
Preallocation mode ( off|metadata|falloc|full ) for raw and qcow2 images on
file-based storages. The default is metadata , which is treated like off for
raw images. When using network storages in combination with large qcow2
images, using off can help to avoid timeouts.
It is not advisable to use the same storage pool on different
Proxmox VE clusters. Some storage operation need exclusive access to the
storage, so proper locking is required. While this is implemented
within a cluster, it does not work between different clusters.
Volumes
We use a special notation to address storage data. When you allocate
data from a storage pool, it returns such a volume identifier. A volume
is identified by the <STORAGE_ID> , followed by a storage type
dependent volume name, separated by colon. A valid <VOLUME_ID> looks
like:
local:230/example-image.raw
local:iso/debian-501-amd64-netinst.iso
local:vztmpl/debian-5.0-joomla_1.5.9-1_i386.tar.gz
iscsi-storage:0.0.2.scsi-14f504e46494c4500494b5042546d2d646744372d31616d61
To get the file system path for a <VOLUME_ID> use:
pvesm path <VOLUME_ID>
Volume Ownership
There exists an ownership relation for image type volumes. Each such
volume is owned by a VM or Container. For example volume
local:230/example-image.raw is owned by VM 230. Most storage
backends encodes this ownership information into the volume name.
When you remove a VM or Container, the system also removes all
associated volumes which are owned by that VM or Container.
Using the Command-line Interface
It is recommended to familiarize yourself with the concept behind storage
pools and volume identifiers, but in real life, you are not forced to do any
of those low level operations on the command line. Normally,
allocation and removal of volumes is done by the VM and Container
management tools.
Nevertheless, there is a command-line tool called pvesm (“Proxmox VE
Storage Manager”), which is able to perform common storage management
tasks.
Examples
Add storage pools
pvesm add <TYPE> <STORAGE_ID> <OPTIONS>
pvesm add dir <STORAGE_ID> --path <PATH>
pvesm add nfs <STORAGE_ID> --path <PATH> --server <SERVER> --export <EXPORT>
pvesm add lvm <STORAGE_ID> --vgname <VGNAME>
pvesm add iscsi <STORAGE_ID> --portal <HOST[:PORT]> --target <TARGET>
Disable storage pools
pvesm set <STORAGE_ID> --disable 1
Enable storage pools
pvesm set <STORAGE_ID> --disable 0
Change/set storage options
pvesm set <STORAGE_ID> <OPTIONS>
pvesm set <STORAGE_ID> --shared 1
pvesm set local --format qcow2
pvesm set <STORAGE_ID> --content iso
Remove storage pools. This does not delete any data, and does not
disconnect or unmount anything. It just removes the storage
configuration.
pvesm remove <STORAGE_ID>
Allocate volumes
pvesm alloc <STORAGE_ID> <VMID> <name> <size> [--format <raw|qcow2>]
Allocate a 4G volume in local storage. The name is auto-generated if
you pass an empty string as <name>
pvesm alloc local <VMID> '' 4G
Free volumes
pvesm free <VOLUME_ID>
This really destroys all volume data.
List storage status
pvesm status
List storage contents
pvesm list <STORAGE_ID> [--vmid <VMID>]
List volumes allocated by VMID
pvesm list <STORAGE_ID> --vmid <VMID>
List iso images
pvesm list <STORAGE_ID> --content iso
List container templates
pvesm list <STORAGE_ID> --content vztmpl
Show file system path for a volume
Exporting the volume local:103/vm-103-disk-0.qcow2 to the file target .
This is mostly used internally with pvesm import .
The stream format qcow2+size is different to the qcow2 format.
Consequently, the exported file cannot simply be attached to a VM.
This also holds for the other formats.
pvesm export local:103/vm-103-disk-0.qcow2 qcow2+size target --with-snapshots 1
Directory Backend
Storage pool type: dir
Proxmox VE can use local directories or locally mounted shares for
storage. A directory is a file level storage, so you can store any
content type like virtual disk images, containers, templates, ISO images
or backup files.
You can mount additional storages via standard linux /etc/fstab ,
and then define a directory storage for that mount point. This way you
can use any file system supported by Linux.
This backend assumes that the underlying directory is POSIX
compatible, but nothing else. This implies that you cannot create
snapshots at the storage level. But there exists a workaround for VM
images using the qcow2 file format, because that format supports
snapshots internally.
Some storage types do not support O_DIRECT , so you can’t use
cache mode none with such storages. Simply use cache mode
writeback instead.
We use a predefined directory layout to store different content types
into different sub-directories. This layout is used by all file level
storage backends.
Table 2. Directory layout Content type Subdir
VM images
images/<VMID>/
template/iso/
Container templates

Import

Configuration
This backend supports all common storage properties, and adds two
additional properties. The path property is used to specify the
directory. This needs to be an absolute file system path.
The optional content-dirs property allows for the default layout
to be changed. It consists of a comma-separated list of identifiers
in the following format:
vtype=path
Where vtype is one of the allowed content types for the storage, and
path is a path relative to the mountpoint of the storage.
Configuration Example ( /etc/pve/storage.cfg )
dir: backup
path /mnt/backup
content backup
prune-backups keep-last=7
max-protected-backups 3
content-dirs backup=custom/backup/dir
The above configuration defines a storage pool called backup . That pool can be
used to store up to 7 regular backups ( keep-last=7 ) and 3 protected backups
per VM. The real path for the backup files is /mnt/backup/custom/backup/dir/... .
File naming conventions
This backend uses a well defined naming scheme for VM images:
vm-<VMID>-<NAME>.<FORMAT>
<VMID>
This specifies the owner VM.
<NAME>
This can be an arbitrary name ( ascii ) without white space. The
backend uses disk-[N] as default, where [N] is replaced by an
integer to make the name unique.
<FORMAT>
Specifies the image format ( raw|qcow2|vmdk ).
When you create a VM template, all VM images are renamed to indicate
that they are now read-only, and can be used as a base image for clones:
base-<VMID>-<NAME>.<FORMAT>
Such base images are used to generate cloned images. So it is
important that those files are read-only, and never get modified. The
backend changes the access mode to 0444 , and sets the immutable flag
( chattr +i ) if the storage supports that.
Storage Features
As mentioned above, most file systems do not support snapshots out
of the box. To workaround that problem, this backend is able to use
qcow2 internal snapshot capabilities.
Same applies to clones. The backend uses the qcow2 base image
feature to create clones.

The image name must conform to above naming conventions.
The real file system path is shown with:
# pvesm path local:100/vm-100-disk10.raw
/var/lib/vz/images/100/vm-100-disk10.raw
And you can remove the image with:
# pvesm free local:100/vm-100-disk10.raw
NFS Backend
Storage pool type: nfs
The NFS backend is based on the directory backend, so it shares most
properties. The directory layout and the file naming conventions are
the same. The main advantage is that you can directly configure the
NFS server properties, so the backend can mount the share
automatically. There is no need to modify /etc/fstab . The backend
can also test if the server is online, and provides a method to query
the server for exported shares.
The backend supports all common storage properties, except the shared
flag, which is always set. Additionally, the following properties are
used to configure the NFS server:
server
Server IP or DNS name. To avoid DNS lookup delays, it is usually
preferable to use an IP address instead of a DNS name - unless you
have a very reliable DNS server, or list the server in the local
/etc/hosts file.
export
NFS export path (as listed by pvesm nfsscan ).
You can also set NFS mount options:
path
The local mount point (defaults to /mnt/pve/<STORAGE_ID>/ ).
content-dirs
Overrides for the default directory layout. Optional.
options
NFS mount options (see man nfs ).
nfs: iso-templates
path /mnt/pve/iso-templates
server 10.0.0.10
export /space/iso-templates
options vers=3,soft
content iso,vztmpl
After an NFS request times out, NFS request are retried
indefinitely by default. This can lead to unexpected hangs on the
client side. For read-only content, it is worth to consider the NFS
soft option, which limits the number of retries to three.
NFS does not support snapshots, but the backend uses qcow2 features
to implement snapshots and cloning.

CIFS Backend
Storage pool type: cifs
The CIFS backend extends the directory backend, so that no manual
setup of a CIFS mount is needed. Such a storage can be added directly
through the Proxmox VE API or the web UI, with all our backend advantages,
like server heartbeat check or comfortable selection of exported
shares.
flag, which is always set. Additionally, the following CIFS special
properties are available:
Server IP or DNS name. Required.
To avoid DNS lookup delays, it is usually preferable to use an IP
address instead of a DNS name - unless you have a very reliable DNS
server, or list the server in the local /etc/hosts file.
share
CIFS share to use (get available ones with pvesm scan cifs <address> or the
web UI). Required.
username
The username for the CIFS storage. Optional, defaults to ‘guest’.
password
The user password. Optional.
It will be saved in a file only readable by root
( /etc/pve/priv/storage/<STORAGE-ID>.pw ).

Sets the user domain (workgroup) for this storage. Optional.
smbversion
SMB protocol Version. Optional, default is 3 .
SMB1 is not supported due to security issues.
The local mount point. Optional, defaults to /mnt/pve/<STORAGE_ID>/ .
Additional CIFS mount options (see man mount.cifs ). Some options are set
automatically and shouldn’t be set here. Proxmox VE will always set the option
soft . Depending on the configuration, these options are set automatically:
username , credentials , guest , domain , vers .
subdir
The subdirectory of the share to mount. Optional, defaults to the root directory
of the share.

You can get a list of exported CIFS shares with:
# pvesm scan cifs <server> [--username <username>] [--password]
Then you can add one of these shares as a storage to the whole Proxmox VE cluster

# pvesm add cifs <storagename> --server <server> --share <share> [--username <username>] [--password]
Proxmox Backup Server
Storage pool type: pbs
This backend allows direct integration of a
Proxmox
Backup Server into Proxmox VE like any other storage.
A Proxmox Backup storage can be added directly through the Proxmox VE API, CLI or
the web interface.
The backend supports all common storage properties, except the shared flag,
which is always set. Additionally, the following special properties to Proxmox
Backup Server are available:
port
Use this port instead of the default one, i.e. 8007 . Optional.
The username for the Proxmox Backup Server storage. Required.
Do not forget to add the realm to the username. For example, root@pam or
archiver@pbs .
The user password. The value will be saved in a file under
/etc/pve/priv/storage/<STORAGE-ID>.pw with access restricted to the root
user. Required.
datastore
The ID of the Proxmox Backup Server datastore to use. Required.
fingerprint
The fingerprint of the Proxmox Backup Server API TLS certificate. You can get
it in the Servers Dashboard or using the proxmox-backup-manager cert info
command. Required for self-signed certificates or any other one where the host
does not trusts the servers CA.
encryption-key
A key to encrypt the backup data from the client side. Currently only
non-password protected (no key derive function (kdf)) are supported. Will be
saved in a file under /etc/pve/priv/storage/<STORAGE-ID>.enc with access
restricted to the root user. Use the magic value autogen to automatically
generate a new one using proxmox-backup-client key create --kdf none <path> .
Optional.
master-pubkey
A public RSA key used to encrypt the backup encryption key as part of the
backup task. Will be saved in a file under
/etc/pve/priv/storage/<STORAGE-ID>.master.pem with access restricted to the
root user.
The encrypted copy of the backup encryption key will be appended to each backup
and stored on the Proxmox Backup Server instance for recovery purposes.
Optional, requires encryption-key .

Proxmox Backup Server only supports backups, they can be block-level or
file-level based. Proxmox VE uses block-level for virtual machines and file-level for
container.
Table 6. Storage features for backend pbs Content types Image formats Shared Snapshots Clones
Encryption
Optionally, you can configure client-side encryption with AES-256 in GCM mode.
Encryption can be configured either via the web interface, or on the CLI with
the encryption-key option (see above). The key will be saved in the file
/etc/pve/priv/storage/<STORAGE-ID>.enc , which is only accessible by the root
user.
Without their key, backups will be inaccessible. Thus, you should
keep keys ordered and in a place that is separate from the contents being
backed up. It can happen, for example, that you back up an entire system, using
a key on that system. If the system then becomes inaccessible for any reason
and needs to be restored, this will not be possible as the encryption key will be
lost along with the broken system.
It is recommended that you keep your key safe, but easily accessible, in
order for quick disaster recovery. For this reason, the best place to store it
is in your password manager, where it is immediately recoverable. As a backup to
this, you should also save the key to a USB flash drive and store that in a secure
place. This way, it is detached from any system, but is still easy to recover
from, in case of emergency. Finally, in preparation for the worst case scenario,
you should also consider keeping a paper copy of your key locked away in a safe
place. The paperkey subcommand can be used to create a QR encoded version of
your key. The following command sends the output of the paperkey command to
a text file, for easy printing.
# proxmox-backup-client key paperkey /etc/pve/priv/storage/<STORAGE-ID>.enc --output-format text > qrkey.txt
Additionally, it is possible to use a single RSA master key pair for key
recovery purposes: configure all clients doing encrypted backups to use a
single public master key, and all subsequent encrypted backups will contain a
RSA-encrypted copy of the used AES encryption key. The corresponding private
master key allows recovering the AES key and decrypting the backup even if the
client system is no longer available.
The same safe-keeping rules apply to the master key pair as to the
regular encryption keys. Without a copy of the private key recovery is not
possible! The paperkey command supports generating paper copies of private
master keys for storage in a safe, physical location.
Because the encryption is managed on the client side, you can use the same
datastore on the server for unencrypted backups and encrypted backups, even
if they are encrypted with different keys. However, deduplication between
backups with different keys is not possible, so it is often better to create
separate datastores.
Do not use encryption if there is no benefit from it, for example, when
you are running the server locally in a trusted network. It is always easier to
recover from unencrypted backups.
Example: Add Storage over CLI
You can get a list of available Proxmox Backup Server datastores with:
# pvesm scan pbs <server> <username> [--password <string>] [--fingerprint <string>]
Then you can add one of these datastores as a storage to the whole Proxmox VE
cluster with:
# pvesm add pbs <id> --server <server> --datastore <datastore> --username <username> --fingerprint 00:B4:... --password
Local ZFS Pool Backend
Storage pool type: zfspool
This backend allows you to access local ZFS pools (or ZFS file systems
inside such pools).
The backend supports the common storage properties content , nodes ,
disable , and the following ZFS specific properties:
pool
Select the ZFS pool/filesystem. All allocations are done within that
pool.
blocksize
Set ZFS blocksize parameter.
Use ZFS thin-provisioning. A sparse volume is a volume whose
reservation is not equal to the volume size.
mountpoint
The mount point of the ZFS pool/filesystem. Changing this does not
affect the mountpoint property of the dataset seen by zfs .
Defaults to /<pool> .
zfspool: vmdata
pool tank/vmdata
The backend uses the following naming scheme for VM images:
vm-<VMID>-<NAME> // normal VM images
base-<VMID>-<NAME> // template VM image (read-only)
subvol-<VMID>-<NAME> // subvolumes (ZFS filesystem for containers)
backend uses disk[N] as default, where [N] is replaced by an
ZFS is probably the most advanced storage type regarding snapshot and
cloning. The backend uses ZFS datasets for both VM images (format
raw ) and container data (format subvol ). ZFS properties are
inherited from the parent dataset, so you can simply set defaults
on the parent dataset.
Table 7. Storage features for backend zfs Content types Image formats Shared Snapshots Clones
images rootdir
raw subvol
ZFS supports encryption of dataset hierarchies. Each encrypted dataset, is
either an encryption_root , storing the properties for encryption itself or
descendant of its encryption_root - see the zfs-load-key(8) manpage for
details.
Sending and receiving encrypted datasets is subject to constraints as some
encryption parameters (initialization vectors for the symmetric ciphers) need
to be either transferred with the data, breaking inheriting the encryption
properties on the receiving side, or need to be recreated on target, requiring
the data to be sent unencrypted - see the zfs-recv(8) manpage for details.
For migration and storage replication of encrypted datasets in Proxmox VE, the
data is sent without the encryption properties, and the state of encryption
is determined by the target.
If you want to send and receive encrypted ZFS datasets, you need to ensure that
all involved storages on all nodes are encrypted.
It is recommended to create an extra ZFS file system to store your VM images:
# zfs create tank/vmdata
To enable compression on that newly allocated file system:
# zfs set compression=on tank/vmdata
You can get a list of available ZFS filesystems with:
# pvesm scan zfs
LVM Backend
Storage pool type: lvm
LVM is a lightweight software layer that sits on top of hard disks and
partitions. It can be used to divide available disk space into smaller logical
volumes.
Another use case is placing LVM on top of a large iSCSI LUN (Logical Unit
Number) or a SAN (Storage Area Network) connected via Fibre Channel.
This allows you to easily manage the space on the iSCSI LUN, which would
otherwise be impossible because the iSCSI specification does not define a
management interface for space allocation.
The LVM backend supports the common storage properties content , nodes ,
disable , and the following LVM specific properties:
vgname
LVM volume group name. This must point to an existing volume group.
base
Base volume. This volume is automatically activated before accessing
the storage. This is mostly useful when the LVM volume group resides
on a remote iSCSI server.
saferemove
Called "Wipe Removed Volumes" in the web UI. Zero-out data when removing LVs.
When removing a volume, this makes sure that all data gets erased and cannot be
accessed by other LVs created later (which happen to be assigned the same
physical extents). This is a costly operation, but may be required as a security
measure in certain environments.
Storage devices that support the "write zeroes" operation will use blkdiscard
to zero blocks. Otherwise, a fallback to cstream is performed.
saferemove-stepsize
Wipe step size in MiB ( blkdiscard -p parameter value), capped to the maximum
step size supported by the underlying storage. Up to 32 MiB (maximum) by
default.
saferemove_throughput
Wipe throughput ( cstream -t parameter value), up to 10 MiB/s by default.
snapshot-as-volume-chain
Set this flag to enable snapshot support for virtual machines on LVM with a
volume backing chain.
With this setting, taking a snapshot persists the current state under the
snapshot’s name and starts a new volume backed by the snapshot.
A volume based on a snapshot references its parent snapshot volume as its
backing volume and records only the differences to that backing volume.
Snapshot volumes are currently thick-provisioned LVM logical volumes.
This design avoids issues with native LVM snapshots, such as significant
input/output (I/O) penalties and unexpected, dangerous behavior when running out
of pre-allocated space.
Snapshots as volume chains provide vendor-agnostic support for snapshots on any
storage system that supports block storage. This includes iSCSI and Fibre
Channel-attached SANs.
Note that, although this feature relies on qcow2, it only uses qcow2’s ability
to layer multiple volumes in a backing chain, not qcow2’s snapshot
functionality.
The snapshot functionality is managed by the PVE storage system.
Enabling or disabling this flag only affects newly created virtual disk volumes.
For efficient support of snapshot-as-volume-chain , the backing storage must
support thin-provisioning and discard. Each snapshot will appear to use the
full volume size on the PVE side, but the actual space usage on the underlying
storage will be smaller if those requirements are met.
Snapshots as volume chains are currently a technology preview in Proxmox VE.
lvm: myspace
vgname myspace
The backend use basically the same naming conventions as the ZFS pool
backend.
LVM is a typical block storage system.
Unfortunately, regular LVM snapshots are inefficient because they interfere with
all write operations within the entire volume group while the snapshot is
active, which causes significant I/O degradation.
This is why LVM does not support linked clones, and why Proxmox VE added support for
snapshots as volume chains. This feature manages the snapshot volume through the
storage plugin and uses qcow2 to layer separate volumes as a backing chain. This
creates a single disk state that is exposed to the guest.
A benefit of LVM is that it can be used with shared storage.
For example, an iSCSI LUN. The backend implements proper cluster-wide locking if
the storage is marked as shared in the configuration.
You can use the LVM-thin backend for non-shared local storage. It supports
snapshots and linked clones.

You can get a list of available LVM volume groups with:

LVM thin Backend
Storage pool type: lvmthin
LVM normally allocates blocks when you create a volume. LVM thin pools
instead allocates blocks when they are written. This behaviour is
called thin-provisioning, because volumes can be much larger than
physically available space.
You can use the normal LVM command-line tools to manage and create LVM
thin pools (see man lvmthin for details). Assuming you already have
a LVM volume group called pve , the following commands create a new
LVM thin pool (size 100G) called data :
lvcreate -L 100G -n data pve
lvconvert --type thin-pool pve/data
The LVM thin backend supports the common storage properties content , nodes ,
thinpool
The name of the LVM thin pool.
LVM thin is a block storage, but fully supports snapshots and clones
efficiently. New volumes are automatically initialized with zero.
It must be mentioned that LVM thin pools cannot be shared across
multiple nodes, so you can only use them as local storage.

You can get a list of available LVM thin pools on the volume group pve with:

Open-iSCSI initiator
Storage pool type: iscsi
iSCSI is a widely employed technology used to connect to storage
servers. Almost all storage vendors support iSCSI. There are also open
source iSCSI target solutions available,
e.g. OpenMediaVault , which is based on
Debian.
To use this backend, you need to install the
Open-iSCSI ( open-iscsi ) package. This is a
standard Debian package, but it is not installed by default to save
resources.
# apt-get install open-iscsi
Low-level iscsi management task can be done using the iscsiadm tool.

portal
iSCSI portal (IP or DNS name with optional port).
target
iSCSI target.
iscsi: mynas
portal 10.10.10.1
target iqn.2006-01.openfiler.com:tsn.dcb5aaaddd
content none
If you want to use LVM on top of iSCSI, it make sense to set
content none . That way it is not possible to create VMs using iSCSI
LUNs directly.
The iSCSI protocol does not define an interface to allocate or delete
data. Instead, that needs to be done on the target side and is vendor
specific. The target simply exports them as numbered LUNs. So Proxmox VE
iSCSI volume names just encodes some information about the LUN as seen
by the linux kernel.
iSCSI is a block level type storage, and provides no management
interface. So it is usually best to export one big LUN, and setup LVM
on top of that LUN. You can then use the LVM plugin to manage the
storage on that iSCSI LUN.

You can scan a remote iSCSI portal and get a list of possible targets with:
pvesm scan iscsi <HOST[:PORT]>
User Mode iSCSI Backend
Storage pool type: iscsidirect
This backend provides basically the same functionality as the Open-iSCSI backed,
but uses a user-level library to implement it. You need to install the
libiscsi-bin package in order to use this backend.
It should be noted that there are no kernel drivers involved, so this
can be viewed as performance optimization. But this comes with the
drawback that you cannot use LVM on top of such iSCSI LUN. So you need
to manage all space allocations at the storage server side.
The user mode iSCSI backend uses the same configuration options as the
Open-iSCSI backed.
iscsidirect: faststore
This backend works with VMs only. Containers cannot use this
driver.

Ceph RADOS Block Devices (RBD)
Storage pool type: rbd
Ceph is a distributed object store and file system
designed to provide excellent performance, reliability and
scalability. RADOS block devices implement a feature rich block level
storage, and you get the following advantages:
thin provisioning
resizable volumes
distributed and redundant (striped over multiple OSDs)
full snapshot and clone capabilities
self healing
no single point of failure
scalable to the exabyte level
kernel and user space implementation available
For smaller deployments, it is also possible to run Ceph
services directly on your Proxmox VE nodes. Recent hardware has plenty
of CPU power and RAM, so running storage services and VMs on same node
is possible.
This backend supports the common storage properties nodes ,
disable , content , and the following rbd specific properties:
monhost
List of monitor daemon IPs. Optional, only needed if Ceph is not running on the
Proxmox VE cluster.
Ceph pool name.
RBD user ID. Optional, only needed if Ceph is not running on the Proxmox VE cluster.
Note that only the user ID should be used. The "client." type prefix must be
left out.
krbd
Enforce access to rados block devices through the krbd kernel module. Optional.
Containers will use krbd independent of the option value.
Configuration Example for a external Ceph cluster ( /etc/pve/storage.cfg )
rbd: ceph-external
monhost 10.1.1.20 10.1.1.21 10.1.1.22
pool ceph-external
content images
username admin
You can use the rbd utility to do low-level management tasks.
Authentication
If Ceph is installed locally on the Proxmox VE cluster, the following is done
automatically when adding the storage.
If you use cephx authentication, which is enabled by default, you need to
provide the keyring from the external Ceph cluster.
To configure the storage via the CLI, you first need to make the file
containing the keyring available. One way is to copy the file from the external
Ceph cluster directly to one of the Proxmox VE nodes. The following example will
copy it to the /root directory of the node on which we run it:
# scp <external cephserver>:/etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring /root/rbd.keyring
Then use the pvesm CLI tool to configure the external RBD storage, use the
--keyring parameter, which needs to be a path to the keyring file that you
copied. For example:
# pvesm add rbd <name> --monhost "10.1.1.20 10.1.1.21 10.1.1.22" --content images --keyring /root/rbd.keyring
When configuring an external RBD storage via the GUI, you can copy and paste
the keyring into the appropriate field.
The keyring will be stored at
# /etc/pve/priv/ceph/<STORAGE_ID>.keyring
Creating a keyring with only the needed capabilities is recommended when
connecting to an external cluster. For further information on Ceph user
management, see the Ceph docs.
[ Ceph User Management ]
Ceph client configuration (optional)
Connecting to an external Ceph storage doesn’t always allow setting
client-specific options in the config DB on the external cluster. You can add a
ceph.conf beside the Ceph keyring to change the Ceph client configuration for
the storage.
The ceph.conf needs to have the same name as the storage.
# /etc/pve/priv/ceph/<STORAGE_ID>.conf
See the RBD configuration reference
[RBD configuration reference
https://docs.ceph.com/en/tentacle/rbd/rbd-config-ref/ ]
for possible settings.
Do not change these settings lightly. Proxmox VE is merging the
<STORAGE_ID>.conf with the storage configuration.
The rbd backend is a block level storage, and implements full
snapshot and clone functionality.

Ceph Filesystem (CephFS)
Storage pool type: cephfs
CephFS implements a POSIX-compliant filesystem, using a Ceph
storage cluster to store its data. As CephFS builds upon Ceph, it shares most of
its properties. This includes redundancy, scalability, self-healing, and high
availability.
Proxmox VE can manage Ceph setups , which makes
configuring a CephFS storage easier. As modern hardware offers a lot of
processing power and RAM, running storage services and VMs on same node is
possible without a significant performance impact.
To use the CephFS storage plugin, you must replace the stock Debian Ceph client,
by adding our Ceph repository .
Once added, run apt update , followed by apt dist-upgrade , in order to get
the newest packages.
Please ensure that there are no other Ceph repositories configured.
Otherwise the installation will fail or there will be mixed package versions on
the node, leading to unexpected behavior.
disable , content , as well as the following cephfs specific properties:
fs-name

List of monitor daemon addresses. Optional, only needed if Ceph is not running
on the Proxmox VE cluster.
Ceph user id. Optional, only needed if Ceph is not running on the Proxmox VE cluster,
where it defaults to admin .
CephFS subdirectory to mount. Optional, defaults to / .
fuse
Access CephFS through FUSE, instead of the kernel client. Optional, defaults

provide the secret from the external Ceph cluster.
containing the secret available. One way is to copy the file from the external
# scp <external cephserver>:/etc/ceph/cephfs.secret /root/cephfs.secret
Then use the pvesm CLI tool to configure the external CephFS storage, use
the --keyring parameter, which needs to be a path to the secret file that
you copied. For example:
# pvesm add cephfs <name> --monhost "10.1.1.20 10.1.1.21 10.1.1.22" --content backup --keyring /root/cephfs.secret
When configuring an external CephFS storage via the GUI, you can copy and
paste the secret into the appropriate field.
The secret is only the key itself, as opposed to the rbd backend which also
contains a [client.userid] section.
The secret will be stored at
# /etc/pve/priv/ceph/<STORAGE_ID>.secret
A secret can be received from the Ceph cluster (as Ceph admin) by issuing the
command below, where userid is the client ID that has been configured to
access the cluster. For further information on Ceph user management, see the
Ceph docs.
[cephusermgmt]
# ceph auth get-key client.userid > cephfs.secret
The cephfs backend is a POSIX-compliant filesystem, on top of a Ceph cluster.

[1] While no known bugs exist, snapshots are not yet guaranteed to be stable,
as they lack sufficient testing.
BTRFS Backend
Storage pool type: btrfs
On the surface, this storage type is very similar to the directory storage type,
so see the directory backend section for a general overview.
The main difference is that with this storage type raw formatted disks will be
placed in a subvolume, in order to allow taking snapshots and supporting offline
storage migration with snapshots being preserved.
BTRFS will honor the O_DIRECT flag when opening files, meaning VMs
should not use cache mode none , otherwise there will be checksum errors.
This backend is configured similarly to the directory storage. Note that when
adding a directory as a BTRFS storage, which is not itself also the mount point,
it is highly recommended to specify the actual mount point via the
is_mountpoint option.
For example, if a BTRFS file system is mounted at /mnt/data2 and its
pve-storage/ subdirectory (which may be a snapshot, which is recommended)
should be added as a storage pool called data2 , you can use the following
entry:
btrfs: data2
path /mnt/data2/pve-storage
is_mountpoint /mnt/data2
Snapshots
When taking a snapshot of a subvolume or raw file, the snapshot will be
created as a read-only subvolume with the same path followed by an @ and the
snapshot’s name.
ZFS over ISCSI Backend
Storage pool type: zfs
This backend accesses a remote machine having a ZFS pool as storage and an iSCSI
target implementation via ssh . For each guest disk it creates a ZVOL and,
exports it as iSCSI LUN. This LUN is used by Proxmox VE for the guest disk.
The following iSCSI target implementations are supported:
LIO (Linux)
IET (Linux)
ISTGT (FreeBSD)
Comstar (Solaris)
This plugin needs a ZFS capable remote storage appliance, you cannot use
it to create a ZFS Pool on a regular Storage Appliance/SAN
In order to use the ZFS over iSCSI plugin you need to configure the remote
machine (target) to accept ssh connections from the Proxmox VE node. Proxmox VE connects to the target for creating the ZVOLs and exporting them via iSCSI.
Authentication is done through a ssh-key (without password protection) stored in
/etc/pve/priv/zfs/<target_ip>_id_rsa
The following steps create a ssh-key and distribute it to the storage machine
with IP 192.0.2.1:
mkdir /etc/pve/priv/zfs
ssh-keygen -f /etc/pve/priv/zfs/192.0.2.1_id_rsa
ssh-copy-id -i /etc/pve/priv/zfs/192.0.2.1_id_rsa.pub root@192.0.2.1
ssh -i /etc/pve/priv/zfs/192.0.2.1_id_rsa root@192.0.2.1
