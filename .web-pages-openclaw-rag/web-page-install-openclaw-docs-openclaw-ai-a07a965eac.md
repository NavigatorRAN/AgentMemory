Install Install overview
System requirements
Node 24 (recommended) or Node 22.19+ - the installer script handles this automatically
macOS, Linux, or Windows - Windows users can start with the native Windows Hub app, the PowerShell CLI installer, or a WSL2 Gateway. See Windows .
pnpm is only needed if you build from source
Recommended: installer script
The fastest way to install. It detects your OS, installs Node if needed, installs OpenClaw, and launches onboarding.
Note
Windows desktop users can also install the native Windows Hub companion app, which includes setup, tray status, chat, node mode, and local MCP mode.
macOS / Linux / WSL2
bash Copy code curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
Windows (PowerShell)
powershell Copy code iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
To install without running onboarding:
bash Copy code curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-onboard
powershell Copy code & ([ scriptblock ]::Create(( iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1))) -NoOnboard
For all flags and CI/automation options, see Installer internals .
Alternative install methods
Local prefix installer ( install-cli.sh )
Use this when you want OpenClaw and Node kept under a local prefix such as
~/.openclaw , without depending on a system-wide Node install:
bash Copy code curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install-cli.sh | bash
It supports npm installs by default, plus git-checkout installs under the same
prefix flow. Full reference: Installer internals .
Already installed? Switch between package and git installs with
openclaw update --channel dev and openclaw update --channel stable . See
Updating .
npm, pnpm, or bun
If you already manage Node yourself:
npm
bash Copy code npm install -g openclaw@latest openclaw onboard --install-daemon Note
The hosted installer clears npm freshness filters such as min-release-age
for the OpenClaw package install. If you install manually with npm, your own
npm policy still applies.
pnpm
bash Copy code pnpm add -g openclaw@latest pnpm approve-builds -g openclaw onboard --install-daemon Note
pnpm requires explicit approval for packages with build scripts. Run pnpm approve-builds -g after the first install.
bun
bash Copy code bun add -g openclaw@latest openclaw onboard --install-daemon Note
Bun is supported for the global CLI install path. For the Gateway runtime, Node remains the recommended daemon runtime.
From source
For contributors or anyone who wants to run from a local checkout:
bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git cd openclaw pnpm install && pnpm build && pnpm ui:build pnpm link --global openclaw onboard --install-daemon
Or skip the link and use pnpm openclaw ... from inside the repo. See Setup for full development workflows.
Install from the GitHub main checkout
bash Copy code curl -fsSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method git --version main
Containers and package managers
Docker
Containerized or headless deployments.
Podman
Rootless container alternative to Docker.
Nix
Declarative install via Nix flake.
Ansible
Automated fleet provisioning.
Bun
CLI-only usage via the Bun runtime.
Verify the install
bash Copy code openclaw --version # confirm the CLI is available openclaw doctor # check for config issues openclaw gateway status # verify the Gateway is running
If you want managed startup after install:
macOS: LaunchAgent via openclaw onboard --install-daemon or openclaw gateway install
Linux/WSL2: systemd user service via the same commands
Native Windows: Scheduled Task first, with a per-user Startup-folder login item fallback if task creation is denied

Troubleshooting: openclaw not found
If the install succeeded but openclaw is not found in your terminal:
bash Copy code node -v # Node installed? npm prefix -g # Where are global packages? echo " $PATH " # Is the global bin dir in PATH?
If $(npm prefix -g)/bin is not in your $PATH , add it to your shell startup file ( ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc ):
bash Copy code export PATH= " $(npm prefix -g) /bin: $PATH "
Then open a new terminal. See Node setup for more details.
