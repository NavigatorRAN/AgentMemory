Troubleshoot node pairing, foreground requirements, permissions, and tool failures

Gateway & Ops Nodes and media
Use this page when a node is visible in status but node tools fail.
Command ladder
bash Copy code openclaw status openclaw gateway status openclaw logs --follow openclaw doctor openclaw channels status --probe
Then run node specific checks:
bash Copy code openclaw nodes status openclaw nodes describe --node <idOrNameOrIp> openclaw approvals get --node <idOrNameOrIp>
Healthy signals:
Node is connected and paired for role node .
nodes describe includes the capability you are calling.
Exec approvals show expected mode/allowlist.
Foreground requirements
canvas.* , camera.* , and screen.* are foreground only on iOS/Android nodes.
Quick check and fix:
bash Copy code openclaw nodes describe --node <idOrNameOrIp> openclaw nodes canvas snapshot --node <idOrNameOrIp> openclaw logs --follow
If you see NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE , bring the node app to the foreground and retry.
Permissions matrix
Capability iOS Android macOS node app Typical failure code camera.snap , camera.clip Camera (+ mic for clip audio) Camera (+ mic for clip audio) Camera (+ mic for clip audio) *_PERMISSION_REQUIRED screen.record Screen Recording (+ mic optional) Screen capture prompt (+ mic optional) Screen Recording *_PERMISSION_REQUIRED location.get While Using or Always (depends on mode) Foreground/Background location based on mode Location permission LOCATION_PERMISSION_REQUIRED system.run n/a (node host path) n/a (node host path) Exec approvals required SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED
Pairing versus approvals
These are different gates:
Device pairing : can this node connect to the gateway?
Gateway node command policy : is the RPC command ID allowed by gateway.nodes.allowCommands / denyCommands and platform defaults?
Exec approvals : can this node run a specific shell command locally?
Quick checks:
bash Copy code openclaw devices list openclaw nodes status openclaw approvals get --node <idOrNameOrIp> openclaw approvals allowlist add --node <idOrNameOrIp> "/usr/bin/uname"
If pairing is missing, approve the node device first.
If nodes describe is missing a command, check the gateway node command policy and whether the node actually declared that command on connect.
If pairing is fine but system.run fails, fix exec approvals/allowlist on that node.
Node pairing is an identity/trust gate, not a per-command approval surface. For system.run , the per-node policy lives in that node's exec approvals file ( openclaw approvals get --node ... ), not in the gateway pairing record.
For approval-backed host=node runs, the gateway also binds execution to the
prepared canonical systemRunPlan . If a later caller mutates command/cwd or
session metadata before the approved run is forwarded, the gateway rejects the
run as an approval mismatch instead of trusting the edited payload.
Common node error codes
NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE → app is backgrounded; bring it foreground.
CAMERA_DISABLED → camera toggle disabled in node settings.
*_PERMISSION_REQUIRED → OS permission missing/denied.
LOCATION_DISABLED → location mode is off.
LOCATION_PERMISSION_REQUIRED → requested location mode not granted.
LOCATION_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE → app is backgrounded but only While Using permission exists.
SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: approval required → exec request needs explicit approval.
SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: allowlist miss → command blocked by allowlist mode.
On Windows node hosts, shell-wrapper forms like cmd.exe /c ... are treated as allowlist misses in
allowlist mode unless approved via ask flow.
Fast recovery loop
bash Copy code openclaw nodes status openclaw nodes describe --node <idOrNameOrIp> openclaw approvals get --node <idOrNameOrIp> openclaw logs --follow
If still stuck:
Re-approve device pairing.
Re-open node app (foreground).
Re-grant OS permissions.
Recreate/adjust exec approval policy.
